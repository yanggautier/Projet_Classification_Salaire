(Remote) Software Engineer;VotingWorks;USA;San Francisco, CA;None;None;A BIT ABOUT US  VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair.  Forty states use voting machines that are over ten years old. Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.  We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment.  THE OPPORTUNITY  We are builders. We don’t just believe in the publicly owned operating system of democracy, we’re building it. We believe in voting machines that delight voters, election officials, and security experts. And we’re building them. We believe election officials need the right software to audit their elections. And we’re building that, too. We’re building the tools to help the public gain confidence that our elections are run well.  If you’re like us, you’ve been thinking about the myriad problems and rough edges of our democracy for a while. We’ve decided that talking about it isn’t enough - we must do something.  THE TEAM  We work as a small, tight-knit team. We’re a flat organization when it comes to ideas and input, and we believe in good management, even as a small organization, so that every VotingWorks team member gets regular feedback, guidance, and an opportunity for tremendous personal growth. We strive to be both confident in the skills and knowledge we each bring and humble in our interactions with each other and other stakeholders in the election space.  THE ROLE  You’ll be writing code, reviewing code, reviewing product specs, contributing to product specs, working directly with voters, election officials, security experts, disability advocates, and more. Your code will help citizens cast and verify their votes.  We don’t work on hip but questionable ideas (ahem.. blockchain voting). We build high-reliability, well-tested and well-architected software that will stand the test of time. We know technology alone won’t fix it. We’re building code with empathy for voters, election officials, and the long history of the democratic process.  We’re looking for software engineers with 10+ years of professional software development and Web technology experience, ideally focused on backend and database. If you're a little bit shy of 10 years but you're particularly excited about the problems we're solving, do send us your resume.  THE STACK  We use Typescript, React, Node.js for the front-end, Python/Flask, PostgreSQL for the backend. We prefer if you know some of these technologies because we’re a small team, but if you don’t and you’re game to learn them, you should still send us your resume.

(Remote) Software Engineer;VotingWorks;USA;San Francisco, CA;None;None;A BIT ABOUT US  VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair.  Forty states use voting machines that are over ten years old. Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.  We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment.  THE OPPORTUNITY  We are builders. We don’t just believe in the publicly owned operating system of democracy, we’re building it. We believe in voting machines that delight voters, election officials, and security experts. And we’re building them. We believe election officials need the right software to audit their elections. And we’re building that, too. We’re building the tools to help the public gain confidence that our elections are run well.  If you’re like us, you’ve been thinking about the myriad problems and rough edges of our democracy for a while. We’ve decided that talking about it isn’t enough - we must do something.  THE TEAM  We work as a small, tight-knit team. We’re a flat organization when it comes to ideas and input, and we believe in good management, even as a small organization, so that every VotingWorks team member gets regular feedback, guidance, and an opportunity for tremendous personal growth. We strive to be both confident in the skills and knowledge we each bring and humble in our interactions with each other and other stakeholders in the election space.  THE ROLE  You’ll be writing code, reviewing code, reviewing product specs, contributing to product specs, working directly with voters, election officials, security experts, disability advocates, and more. Your code will help citizens cast and verify their votes.  We don’t work on hip but questionable ideas (ahem.. blockchain voting). We build high-reliability, well-tested and well-architected software that will stand the test of time. We know technology alone won’t fix it. We’re building code with empathy for voters, election officials, and the long history of the democratic process.  We’re looking for software engineers with 10+ years of professional software development and Web technology experience, ideally focused on backend and database. If you're a little bit shy of 10 years but you're particularly excited about the problems we're solving, do send us your resume.  THE STACK  We use Typescript, React, Node.js for the front-end, Python/Flask, PostgreSQL for the backend. We prefer if you know some of these technologies because we’re a small team, but if you don’t and you’re game to learn them, you should still send us your resume. We’re more interested in how well you understand Web technology and how much you love to learn and improve your skills than in your knowledge of specific programming languages or frameworks. If you prefer backend or frontend, that’s great – almost every engineer has a preference. We’re a small team, though, so you’ll get a chance to work across the stack – and we’ll almost certainly need you to. WITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU'LL contribute features to voting machine and/or verification software. WITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL contribute ideas to the entire architecture of our voting system take ownership of significant portions of our stack start to see your code help election officials and voters. WITHIN 12 MONTHS, YOU'LL be able to say that your code ran a real election in the United States, with many more to come. WE'RE FULLY DISTRIBUTED  We’re a fully distributed organization, which means that for most roles you can work from anywhere in the United States. We offer a flexible work schedule and we're on board with schedule flexibility: more than half of us have kids, and we enjoy attending their various sporting and non-sporting events. With flexibility comes responsibility: you should be comfortable with significant autonomous work.  COMPENSATION  We’re a non-profit, so we compensate in cash and benefits exclusively. We won’t pay you as much as a big for-profit, but we’ll still pay you a very fair salary and competitive benefits. Compensation is commensurate with your skills and experience.  WE'RE BUILDING A DIVERSE TEAM  We never discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, background, ability/disability or really anything that isn’t about your skills.  We strive to go beyond that: we want to build a diverse organization that truly represents the people of the United States of America. We especially want to encourage women and members of under-represented groups to apply.

(Remote) Software Engineer;VotingWorks;USA;San Francisco, CA;None;None;A BIT ABOUT US  VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair.  Forty states use voting machines that are over ten years old. Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.  We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment.  THE OPPORTUNITY  We are builders. We don’t just believe in the publicly owned operating system of democracy, we’re building it. We believe in voting machines that delight voters, election officials, and security experts. And we’re building them. We believe election officials need the right software to audit their elections. And we’re building that, too. We’re building the tools to help the public gain confidence that our elections are run well.  If you’re like us, you’ve been thinking about the myriad problems and rough edges of our democracy for a while. We’ve decided that talking about it isn’t enough - we must do something.  THE TEAM  We work as a small, tight-knit team. We’re a flat organization when it comes to ideas and input, and we believe in good management, even as a small organization, so that every VotingWorks team member gets regular feedback, guidance, and an opportunity for tremendous personal growth. We strive to be both confident in the skills and knowledge we each bring and humble in our interactions with each other and other stakeholders in the election space.  THE ROLE  You’ll be writing code, reviewing code, reviewing product specs, contributing to product specs, working directly with voters, election officials, security experts, disability advocates, and more. Your code will help citizens cast and verify their votes.  We don’t work on hip but questionable ideas (ahem.. blockchain voting). We build high-reliability, well-tested and well-architected software that will stand the test of time. We know technology alone won’t fix it. We’re building code with empathy for voters, election officials, and the long history of the democratic process.  We’re looking for software engineers with 10+ years of professional software development and Web technology experience, ideally focused on backend and database. If you're a little bit shy of 10 years but you're particularly excited about the problems we're solving, do send us your resume.  THE STACK  We use Typescript, React, Node.js for the front-end, Python/Flask, PostgreSQL for the backend. We prefer if you know some of these technologies because we’re a small team, but if you don’t and you’re game to learn them, you should still send us your resume. We’re more interested in how well you understand Web technology and how much you love to learn and improve your skills than in your knowledge of specific programming languages or frameworks. If you prefer backend or frontend, that’s great – almost every engineer has a preference. We’re a small team, though, so you’ll get a chance to work across the stack – and we’ll almost certainly need you to. WITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU'LL contribute features to voting machine and/or verification software. WITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL contribute ideas to the entire architecture of our voting system take ownership of significant portions of our stack start to see your code help election officials and voters. WITHIN 12 MONTHS, YOU'LL be able to say that your code ran a real election in the United States, with many more to come. WE'RE FULLY DISTRIBUTED  We’re a fully distributed organization, which means that for most roles you can work from anywhere in the United States. We offer a flexible work schedule and we're on board with schedule flexibility: more than half of us have kids, and we enjoy attending their various sporting and non-sporting events. With flexibility comes responsibility: you should be comfortable with significant autonomous work.  COMPENSATION  We’re a non-profit, so we compensate in cash and benefits exclusively. We won’t pay you as much as a big for-profit, but we’ll still pay you a very fair salary and competitive benefits. Compensation is commensurate with your skills and experience.  WE'RE BUILDING A DIVERSE TEAM  We never discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, background, ability/disability or really anything that isn’t about your skills.  We strive to go beyond that: we want to build a diverse organization that truly represents the people of the United States of America. We especially want to encourage women and members of under-represented groups to apply.

So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk. About the Role Crowdstrike is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Engine and Content Development (ECD) team which focuses on security related endpoint development on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The Engine and Content Development team is a central part of CrowdStrike’s mission - “We Stop Breaches."" In ECD, we implement strategies and processes that detect suspicious or malicious behavior. Our goal is to automatically stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build capabilities to detect and prevent malicious activity. Our detection strategies are often performed directly on the endpoint, but are also executed in cloud and may utilize a hybrid strategy combining aspects of both environments. This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allows us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers. As a detection engineer within the ECD team you will be focused on the analysis and development of detections for attack techniques across all operating systems. You’ll work collaboratively to implement these detections within the Falcon sensor which is a lightweight kernel-level module that observes system activity, recognizes malicious behavior, provides on-box prevention capability, and sends relevant security related telemetry to the Falcon cloud. You’ll help develop creative and resourceful ways to identify gaps and detect threats while leveraging core OS telemetry such as file system, memory, process, and network. You’ll collaborate with multiple teams within engineering, and will be expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation of major development projects. We're looking for smart people who want to be challenged and take ownership of what they build. You will: Identify gaps in detection capabilities: Understand and track attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as described in ATT&CK Familiarize with offensive security tools and techniques across platforms Evaluate product detection capabilities by planning and executing attack emulation scenarios Design and build detection logic: Extend our existing codebase and test suites utilizing C++, Python, and other tools as appropriate. Brainstorm, define, and build collaboratively across multiple teams. Build elegant, robust, and reliable solutions for complex technical problems. Collaborate as a team-member: Obsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies & tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team. Troubleshoot issues within the product when necessary, assisting customer support. Deliver and accept feedback with grace and courtesy. What You'll Need 5+ years of experience with EITHER one of: Defensive security operations, such as threat intelligence, malware analysis, threat hunting, or detection development; and an interest in threat emulation, or Offensive security operations, such as red-teaming, threat emulation, or offensive capability development; and an interest in detection engineering Team player – able to lead, mentor, communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a globally distributed team. Preferred Qualifications: Prior experience with threat hunting and/or endpoint detection engineering concepts such as gap analysis, detection tuning, and detection testing (e.g. ATT&CK Evaluations, Caldera, Atomic Red-Team) Prior experience building or operating red-team/pen-test/C2 frameworks (e.g. Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, PoshEmpire, CALDERA, Apfel, Empyre) Low-level OS knowledge and experience with one of more of our supported sensor platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Prior development or testing experience with python. Prior experience delivering software via agile processes. #LI-NT1 Benefits of Working at CrowdStrike: Market leader in compensation and equity awards Competitive vacation policy Comprehensive health benefits + 401k plan Paid parental leave, including adoption Flexible work environment Wellness programs Stocked fridges, coffee, soda, and lots of treats We are committed to building an inclusive culture of belonging that not only embraces the diversity of our people but also reflects the diversity of the communities in which we work and the customers we serve. We know that the happiest and highest performing teams include people with diverse perspectives and ways of solving problems so we strive to attract and retain talent from all backgrounds and create workplaces where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work.

(Remote) Software Engineer;VotingWorks;USA;San Francisco, CA;None;None;A BIT ABOUT US  VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair.  Forty states use voting machines that are over ten years old. Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.  We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment.  THE OPPORTUNITY  We are builders. We don’t just believe in the publicly owned operating system of democracy, we’re building it. We believe in voting machines that delight voters, election officials, and security experts. And we’re building them. We believe election officials need the right software to audit their elections. And we’re building that, too. We’re building the tools to help the public gain confidence that our elections are run well.  If you’re like us, you’ve been thinking about the myriad problems and rough edges of our democracy for a while. We’ve decided that talking about it isn’t enough - we must do something.  THE TEAM  We work as a small, tight-knit team. We’re a flat organization when it comes to ideas and input, and we believe in good management, even as a small organization, so that every VotingWorks team member gets regular feedback, guidance, and an opportunity for tremendous personal growth. We strive to be both confident in the skills and knowledge we each bring and humble in our interactions with each other and other stakeholders in the election space.  THE ROLE  You’ll be writing code, reviewing code, reviewing product specs, contributing to product specs, working directly with voters, election officials, security experts, disability advocates, and more. Your code will help citizens cast and verify their votes.  We don’t work on hip but questionable ideas (ahem.. blockchain voting). We build high-reliability, well-tested and well-architected software that will stand the test of time. We know technology alone won’t fix it. We’re building code with empathy for voters, election officials, and the long history of the democratic process.  We’re looking for software engineers with 10+ years of professional software development and Web technology experience, ideally focused on backend and database. If you're a little bit shy of 10 years but you're particularly excited about the problems we're solving, do send us your resume.  THE STACK  We use Typescript, React, Node.js for the front-end, Python/Flask, PostgreSQL for the backend. We prefer if you know some of these technologies because we’re a small team, but if you don’t and you’re game to learn them, you should still send us your resume. We’re more interested in how well you understand Web technology and how much you love to learn and improve your skills than in your knowledge of specific programming languages or frameworks. If you prefer backend or frontend, that’s great – almost every engineer has a preference. We’re a small team, though, so you’ll get a chance to work across the stack – and we’ll almost certainly need you to. WITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU'LL contribute features to voting machine and/or verification software. WITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL contribute ideas to the entire architecture of our voting system take ownership of significant portions of our stack start to see your code help election officials and voters. WITHIN 12 MONTHS, YOU'LL be able to say that your code ran a real election in the United States, with many more to come. WE'RE FULLY DISTRIBUTED  We’re a fully distributed organization, which means that for most roles you can work from anywhere in the United States. We offer a flexible work schedule and we're on board with schedule flexibility: more than half of us have kids, and we enjoy attending their various sporting and non-sporting events. With flexibility comes responsibility: you should be comfortable with significant autonomous work.  COMPENSATION  We’re a non-profit, so we compensate in cash and benefits exclusively. We won’t pay you as much as a big for-profit, but we’ll still pay you a very fair salary and competitive benefits. Compensation is commensurate with your skills and experience.  WE'RE BUILDING A DIVERSE TEAM  We never discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, background, ability/disability or really anything that isn’t about your skills.  We strive to go beyond that: we want to build a diverse organization that truly represents the people of the United States of America. We especially want to encourage women and members of under-represented groups to apply.

(Remote) Software Engineer;VotingWorks;USA;San Francisco, CA;None;None;A BIT ABOUT US  VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair.  Forty states use voting machines that are over ten years old. Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.  We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment.  THE OPPORTUNITY  We are builders. We don’t just believe in the publicly owned operating system of democracy, we’re building it. We believe in voting machines that delight voters, election officials, and security experts. And we’re building them. We believe election officials need the right software to audit their elections. And we’re building that, too. We’re building the tools to help the public gain confidence that our elections are run well.  If you’re like us, you’ve been thinking about the myriad problems and rough edges of our democracy for a while. We’ve decided that talking about it isn’t enough - we must do something.  THE TEAM  We work as a small, tight-knit team. We’re a flat organization when it comes to ideas and input, and we believe in good management, even as a small organization, so that every VotingWorks team member gets regular feedback, guidance, and an opportunity for tremendous personal growth. We strive to be both confident in the skills and knowledge we each bring and humble in our interactions with each other and other stakeholders in the election space.  THE ROLE  You’ll be writing code, reviewing code, reviewing product specs, contributing to product specs, working directly with voters, election officials, security experts, disability advocates, and more. Your code will help citizens cast and verify their votes.  We don’t work on hip but questionable ideas (ahem.. blockchain voting). We build high-reliability, well-tested and well-architected software that will stand the test of time. We know technology alone won’t fix it. We’re building code with empathy for voters, election officials, and the long history of the democratic process.  We’re looking for software engineers with 10+ years of professional software development and Web technology experience, ideally focused on backend and database. If you're a little bit shy of 10 years but you're particularly excited about the problems we're solving, do send us your resume.  THE STACK  We use Typescript, React, Node.js for the front-end, Python/Flask, PostgreSQL for the backend. We prefer if you know some of these technologies because we’re a small team, but if you don’t and you’re game to learn them, you should still send us your resume. We’re more interested in how well you understand Web technology and how much you love to learn and improve your skills than in your knowledge of specific programming languages or frameworks. If you prefer backend or frontend, that’s great – almost every engineer has a preference. We’re a small team, though, so you’ll get a chance to work across the stack – and we’ll almost certainly need you to. WITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU'LL contribute features to voting machine and/or verification software. WITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL contribute ideas to the entire architecture of our voting system take ownership of significant portions of our stack start to see your code help election officials and voters. WITHIN 12 MONTHS, YOU'LL be able to say that your code ran a real election in the United States, with many more to come. WE'RE FULLY DISTRIBUTED  We’re a fully distributed organization, which means that for most roles you can work from anywhere in the United States. We offer a flexible work schedule and we're on board with schedule flexibility: more than half of us have kids, and we enjoy attending their various sporting and non-sporting events. With flexibility comes responsibility: you should be comfortable with significant autonomous work.  COMPENSATION  We’re a non-profit, so we compensate in cash and benefits exclusively. We won’t pay you as much as a big for-profit, but we’ll still pay you a very fair salary and competitive benefits. Compensation is commensurate with your skills and experience.  WE'RE BUILDING A DIVERSE TEAM  We never discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, background, ability/disability or really anything that isn’t about your skills.  We strive to go beyond that: we want to build a diverse organization that truly represents the people of the United States of America. We especially want to encourage women and members of under-represented groups to apply.

Full-Stack Software Developer;Zippity;USA;Boston, MA;None;None;Boston, MA or Remote Click Here to Apply Hey! We’re looking for an entrepreneurial software engineer to join our growing team. Our goal is to transform the personal car ownership experience by delivering radically convenient on-demand auto maintenance, cleaning, and fueling services, all powered by a modern online platform. Zippity eliminates the hassle of wasting hours of the day waiting in a legacy auto repair shop only to be confronted by a bill that’s confusing and expensive. Instead, we bring our custom, 4-season mobile service garages to our customers’ workplaces or homes and help them with everything from basic oil changes to complete brake repairs. Customers book online with transparent, upfront pricing, and our team provides live updates throughout each service so they always know the status of their vehicle. Zippity is already a hit with our customers, earning thousands of 5-star reviews. But we’re not done — we have some ambitious plans to scale this system 100x, and we could use your help to make it happen. What You Might Work On Our customer-facing web app. Every Zippity customer begins here: creating their account, telling us about their vehicle, picking out the services they need, and scheduling a service date. We’ve come pretty far with the app we have, but we know there’s still miles of room to improve the customer experience. Our technician-facing tools. Every Zippity technician’s day is driven by an app that provides every bit of information necessary for their success, lets them communicate with customers, and ensures every service is delivered with quality and efficiency. We need your help to buff this tool so we can grow to support thousands of technicians operating in markets all across the country. Our powerful backend REST API. Our Python backend is much more than a simple CRUD API. It has strong security controls, connects cleanly to 10+ third-party information sources, and enables routing and scheduling algorithms (think Traveling Salesman Problem). If you’re doing services in a mobile environment, efficiency is key — our backend software allows us to continuously improve. Our Tech About You You’ve got an entrepreneurial spirit. You don’t get excited about 10% Year-over-Year growth — you get excited about turning the world upside-down and growing by 100x. Maybe you’ve worked in a startup before. Maybe you were part of a large company but tried to make it feel like a startup. Maybe you contribute to open source. Maybe you have a side project or 3. No matter your background, you are excited to be part of a small team that dreams big. You want to work across both front-end and back-end to deliver a great UX. You’re excited to work on frontend web apps made with React, and to build the backend Python algorithms to support them. (Let’s face it, if you were just working on one small code base, you’d get bored.) If you don’t have prior experience with both React and Python, that’s okay too — in your first week on the job, you’ll start by reviewing code in both languages, and we’ll do some Zoom-powered pair programming for 2-way learning.
