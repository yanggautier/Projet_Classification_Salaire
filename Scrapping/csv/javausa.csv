Software Development Engineer;Java;USA;Tucson, AZ;ABC Legal Services Inc.;;;"Software Development Engineer Are you tired of being stuck in endless meetings, being subjected to frequent company reorgs, and having to talk to multiple managers to get anything accomplished? Are you more interested in being part of a small productive development team of an established and profitable company rather than being an employee number at a mega corporation? Check this out! ABC Legal is a locally owned company of 350 employees and thousands of independent contractors, headquartered in Seattle with a nationwide footprint. We file and serve legal documents for law firms-and are the technology leaders in our industry. Our technology group builds software and infrastructure solutions to support our nationwide operations. Law firms use our website to monitor status on cases; independent contractors use our mobile apps all day every day to record geo-tagged events, take photos, and e-sign declarations; our employees use our desktop application to provide customer support and keep legal documents (electronic and printed) flowing. Our culture is casual, open, and direct. We support independent thinking-freeing you to do your best work. WHAT WE OFFER: Our technology group offers a unique, fun, and challenging opportunity for the right person. Here’s what is great about our technology team: We have an awesome team size. Our group is small enough that every one of us has direct and meaningful impact on our business, but big enough that no one has to go it alone or work long hours. You will wear enough different hats to be challenged...but you don’t have to wear them all. We have an awesome company size. You get the family atmosphere of a start-up without the funding worries. The company has a flat hierarchy with very little middle management and a minimal amount of red tape. Our product management is effective. We have strong and accountable product ownership. Many domain experts work in the same building and it is common practice to just walk up and talk to them in person to get clarification on requirements. Our work / life balance is real. We take long vacations, work normal hours, and lead varied lives. We trust each other. From the CEO down, we have strong support for trying new ideas and changing processes to make them better. Teams communicate well and trust each other. We have a cool office in a cool place. We work in a renovated historic Japanese theater with a rooftop deck with a water view. For lunch, we walk to crazy-good cuisine of all styles in the International District. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: We are looking for Software engineers who enjoy implementing new features and are not afraid to learn many parts of our system along the way (including database, server side and client side). We are a team of senior engineers. We discuss design decisions within the group and are always open to consult each other on implementation details. Our general operating mode however is that once someone signs up for a task they own it and champions it through to completion. The ideal candidate would be a senior engineer that is used to diving into a task and finding a solution, or a junior engineer with a self-starter mentality who is not afraid to get accustomed to many parts of our system and work towards finishing projects more and more independently over time. We all respect each other and don’t hold grudges when the group makes a decision that doesn’t fully align with one’s preference on the particular matter. If you generally have strong opinions on design decisions and have a history of not being able to move on after your team decides against you, then this is probably not a good fit for you. If our team’s mentality suits you and your skills overlap with the skills listed below, then we want to hear from you. Required Technical Skills: BS/BA in Computer Science or related field experience. Java (C#, C++ or similar object oriented languages are acceptable too) Web UI framework like Angular\ React\Vue etc. Desired Technical Skills: Web technologies including JQuery, XHTML, JavaScript, Ajax, XML, HTML, CSS AWS and any popular cloud platform.

Sr. Full Stack Engineer - 70726BR;Java;USA;Chicago, IL (West Loop Gate area);AETNA;;;"Description:  Health Data & Management Solutions, Inc. (HDMS), a subsidiary of CVS/Aetna, is a Software Development Company on the cutting edge of health IT data solutions. Offering data warehouse, management and analysis tools for the healthcare industry, HDMS strives to improve and enhance its product suite for health plans, employers and providers through constant innovation. HDMS' web-based products and services provide flexible, high-value reporting tools that empower users to maximize the value of their health care data and support benefit decisions.  This position's requirements include a solid understanding of language, frameworks, unit testing frameworks on your platform; collects business requirements from interviews and translates into sound, creative software designs that effectively weigh business and technical tradeoffs.  Join a team building the next generation cloud-based products that our clients will use in mining their healthcare information for insight. 70726 Fundamental Components: Key Skills: Demonstrated ability and desire to quickly comprehend complex and unfamiliar codebases. There are no black boxes if you have the source code (and, sometimes, even if you don’t). Strong debugging and analysis skills, forging ahead when the tracks lead off the familiar path. View error messages as an invitation to start a journey rather than a STOP sign. Strive to divine original developer intent when studying existing code, and to puzzle disparate pieces together into cohesive understanding. Know and love ‘git blame’ or equivalent, and relish finding an offhand comment in an old Jira issue that holds the answer to a small mystery! Recognize when you don’t completely understand something germane to the task at hand, and spend the time to gain that understanding, as a prerequisite for a correct and confident solution. Possess an aversion to ‘shotgunning’ problems. Accept the challenges inevitably associated with large legacy code bases and look for ways to leave the place better than you found it. Small improvements add up. Aim to write code that is so clear and concise it looks trivially simple in hindsight, making you wonder how it took you so long to get to that point. Simple solutions are harder to create than complex ones and are much more valuable. Mark Twain captured it well with his quote: “I apologize for such a long letter - I didn't have time to write a short one.”  Key Technologies: Java 8. Overall Java expertise essential; a love of patterns enabled by Java 8’s lambda expressions is…also essential. Immutability! Streams and functional programming paradigms! Sure, there’s plenty of older code that doesn’t use it, but now we can! Spring Framework, with a focus on the core IoC container, Spring MVC controllers, and (for bonus points) Spring Security. Do you really ‘get’ scopes? Great. Have you written your own? Even better! Are dynamic proxies explicable rather than black magic you take on faith? Fantastic; black magic has a dark side. Vaadin UI development knowledge is a plus. Don’t know Vaadin? Some GWT experience gets you halfway there. DVCS experience. Mercurial knowledge is perfect; Git competence and an open mind are good enough. Knowing enough JavaScript to code your way out of a paper bag is helpful; knowing enough CSS to make the bag pretty and responsive is even better.  Background Experience:  Ability to take responsibility for the implementation, quality, and operation of large features, such as an epic-level story or multi-sprint feature. Ability to estimate size accurately and deliver on-time and to specification regularly based on those estimates. Experience translating large features into software designs. 5 years’ software development experience, full life cycle development. 3 years’ experience developing apps on the specific platform. 5+ years’ of practical work experience with Java or JavaScript on a cloud-based platform. Experience using Docker on a cloud-based platform is a plus, particularly having scaled containers across multiple Docker daemons. Experience using continuous deployment / continuous integration (CI / CD) technology. Able to produce coherent and audience friendly written documentation. Professional communication skills both written and verbal.  Additional Job Information: The location is Chicago, IL at the HDMS office- 550 W Washington Blvd.  Clinical Licensure: N/A  Potential Telework Position: Yes  Percent of Travel Required: 0 - 10%  EEO Statement: Aetna is an Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action Employer  Benefit Eligibility: Benefit eligibility may vary by position.  Candidate Privacy Information: Aetna takes our candidate's data privacy seriously.

Software Engineer;Java;USA;San Francisco, CA;Ironclad, Inc.;;;About Ironclad Ironclad is the leading digital contracting platform for legal teams. By streamlining contract workflows, from creation and approvals to compliance and insights, Ironclad frees legal teams to be the strategic advisors they’re meant to be. Ironclad is used by modern General Counsels and their teams at companies like Dropbox, L’Oréal and Fitbit to unlock the power of their contracts data. Ironclad was named one of the 20 Rising Stars as part of the Forbes 2019 Cloud 100 list, the definitive list of the top 100 private cloud companies in the world. The company is backed by investors like Accel, Sequoia, Y Combinator and Emergence Capital. Contracts are the atomic unit of business - everything important that a company does involves a contract: sales, purchases, hires, everything. The process for making a contract happen isn’t that different from the software lifecycle: a cross functional group collaborates on a technical document that essentially needs to be executable - just in a courtroom instead of a computer. Most legal teams are still stuck doing things manually, emailing versions of these documents around seeking approval and revisions with no easy way to automate workflows. Simple questions like “what is blocking this contract?” can be really difficult to answer since the information is locked in someone’s inbox.  Engineering @ Ironclad As an Engineer at Ironclad, you'll work cross-functionally to identify business problems and architect, build, and verify solutions. You'll build a platform that lets lawyers scale themselves and their businesses 100x more effectively. At Ironclad, we’ve built a product that brings a two thousand year old profession into the digital age, and you’ll play a pivotal role in driving the foundation forward. We seek engineers with strong coding fundamentals and a track record of shipping high quality products. We work in a highly collaborative environment, and strive to foster a positive, inclusive culture. If you’d like to join us on our mission to build the product that legal teams love, let’s talk!

Sr. Full Stack Engineer - 70726BR;Java;USA;Chicago, IL (West Loop Gate area);AETNA;;;"Description:  Health Data & Management Solutions, Inc. (HDMS), a subsidiary of CVS/Aetna, is a Software Development Company on the cutting edge of health IT data solutions. Offering data warehouse, management and analysis tools for the healthcare industry, HDMS strives to improve and enhance its product suite for health plans, employers and providers through constant innovation. HDMS' web-based products and services provide flexible, high-value reporting tools that empower users to maximize the value of their health care data and support benefit decisions.  This position's requirements include a solid understanding of language, frameworks, unit testing frameworks on your platform; collects business requirements from interviews and translates into sound, creative software designs that effectively weigh business and technical tradeoffs.  Join a team building the next generation cloud-based products that our clients will use in mining their healthcare information for insight. 70726 Fundamental Components: Key Skills: Demonstrated ability and desire to quickly comprehend complex and unfamiliar codebases. There are no black boxes if you have the source code (and, sometimes, even if you don’t). Strong debugging and analysis skills, forging ahead when the tracks lead off the familiar path. View error messages as an invitation to start a journey rather than a STOP sign. Strive to divine original developer intent when studying existing code, and to puzzle disparate pieces together into cohesive understanding. Know and love ‘git blame’ or equivalent, and relish finding an offhand comment in an old Jira issue that holds the answer to a small mystery! Recognize when you don’t completely understand something germane to the task at hand, and spend the time to gain that understanding, as a prerequisite for a correct and confident solution. Possess an aversion to ‘shotgunning’ problems. Accept the challenges inevitably associated with large legacy code bases and look for ways to leave the place better than you found it. Small improvements add up. Aim to write code that is so clear and concise it looks trivially simple in hindsight, making you wonder how it took you so long to get to that point. Simple solutions are harder to create than complex ones and are much more valuable. Mark Twain captured it well with his quote: “I apologize for such a long letter - I didn't have time to write a short one.”  Key Technologies: Java 8. Overall Java expertise essential; a love of patterns enabled by Java 8’s lambda expressions is…also essential. Immutability! Streams and functional programming paradigms! Sure, there’s plenty of older code that doesn’t use it, but now we can! Spring Framework, with a focus on the core IoC container, Spring MVC controllers, and (for bonus points) Spring Security. Do you really ‘get’ scopes? Great. Have you written your own? Even better! Are dynamic proxies explicable rather than black magic you take on faith? Fantastic; black magic has a dark side. Vaadin UI development knowledge is a plus. Don’t know Vaadin? Some GWT experience gets you halfway there. DVCS experience. Mercurial knowledge is perfect; Git competence and an open mind are good enough. Knowing enough JavaScript to code your way out of a paper bag is helpful; knowing enough CSS to make the bag pretty and responsive is even better.  Background Experience:  Ability to take responsibility for the implementation, quality, and operation of large features, such as an epic-level story or multi-sprint feature. Ability to estimate size accurately and deliver on-time and to specification regularly based on those estimates. Experience translating large features into software designs. 5 years’ software development experience, full life cycle development. 3 years’ experience developing apps on the specific platform. 5+ years’ of practical work experience with Java or JavaScript on a cloud-based platform. Experience using Docker on a cloud-based platform is a plus, particularly having scaled containers across multiple Docker daemons. Experience using continuous deployment / continuous integration (CI / CD) technology. Able to produce coherent and audience friendly written documentation. Professional communication skills both written and verbal.  Additional Job Information: The location is Chicago, IL at the HDMS office- 550 W Washington Blvd.  Clinical Licensure: N/A  Potential Telework Position: Yes  Percent of Travel Required: 0 - 10%  EEO Statement: Aetna is an Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action Employer  Benefit Eligibility: Benefit eligibility may vary by position.  Candidate Privacy Information: Aetna takes our candidate's data privacy seriously. At no time will any Aetna recruiter or employee request any financial or personal information (Social Security Number, Credit card information for direct deposit, etc.) from you via e-mail.
