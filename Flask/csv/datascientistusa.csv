An incredible team of fun, humble but brilliant co-workers  Background Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe. But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job.

Data Scientist, Machine Learning Evaluation;Data scientist;USA;San Francisco, CA 94107 (South of Market area);Adobe;;;Data Scientist, Machine Learning Data  Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe’s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to create and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.  Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Lightroom CC, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.  We are building new machine learning platform, called Adobe Sensei, that powers machine learning and AI across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines. This platform will enable thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!  A crucial piece of developing machine learning solutions is the evaluation process. How do we know the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use for judging them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?  Equally core to the ML process is the training set itself. Such training sets often include human judgments, elicted at large scale, which form the target that the ML process predicts.

We are looking for someone senior enough to know best practices, but still excited to get their hands dirty. You should understand and know how to choose the right tool for any given data problem, even if that tool ends up being a survey or talking to users face to face. YC started as a family business, and we look for low-ego people who prioritize getting the job done over tool or title.  This is a good job for someone who is excited about startups and interested in learning more about them. You’ve likely worked at or started a startup, or want to do so in the future.

Are you interested in bringing an industry into the future with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and automation? Then this role is for you. We're a small team tackling the absolutely massive mortgage market. We're bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manila envelopes. We bring security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.  The type of problems we focus on involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservices is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.  We trust our team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as collaboration. We're becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and now we're looking to hire another Data Scientist to help us expand further!  As the second Data Scientist to join the team, you will focus on aggregating and analyzing large datasets to identify behavior trends using statistics, data mining techniques, and building data models for solving real-world problems. The ideal candidate is someone who relishes pouring over messy data to find patterns and train machines to do so with high accuracy and recall. You will build and update models ( ML and AI ) to automate repetitive repeatable data-driven tasks. You will analyze data generated as a by-product of manual tasks and build models that can operate on similar or better accuracy than humans.  Over the past 2-4 years, you have learned and used advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms to build new models to experiment with data. You have experience in one or more programming languages including Python and R and have used Cloud Platforms, bonus points for AWS. This is a specialized role so advanced degrees in quantitative disciplines like Statistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics are preferred (PhD’s are ideal). Lastly, you are eager to learn! You don’t know every toolset but have proven that with the right problem, a good tutorial, and a healthy appetite for StackOverflow, you’ll figure it out but you don’t mind asking simple questions that result in actionable insights if need be.  Snapdocs’ culture is one that strongly values diversity and drive. We want to work with people of different backgrounds and different paths in life, and we trust our team members to make smart decisions. We value independent work as well as collaboration. Snapdocs provides a ton of excellent benefits ranging from the standard stuff: matching 401(k), free lunches, and 21 days PTO to the not so standard—like a 10 year exercise window on your options. Lastly, our location in downtown Denver is super convenient (we are currently based in the Wells Fargo Center) and close to many public transportation options. 28 days ago report job
