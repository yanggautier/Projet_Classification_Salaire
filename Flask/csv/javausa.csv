Full Stack Developernew;For The Record;USA;Los Angeles, CA;None;None;Full Stack Software Developer About us For The Record (FTR) manages every step to capture, produce, and deliver timely and reliable court records. It’s the complete package for recording confidence and provides both in person and virtual court solutions. Our recording solution is currently installed in thousands of courtrooms in over 60 countries. We are currently developing new SaaS offerings that allow courts to securely store, index, play, and distribute their audio. In this evolving environment, providing access to remote justice has become a priority and our solution is poised to make an immediate impact. For The Record is a global organization based in the United States. We have development teams in the United States and Brisbane, Australia Our Tech and Tools Our tech stack is ever evolving and is chosen by developers working on the product. We like to keep our toolchain modern, but at the same time we don’t immediately rush to bleeding edge tech. We host our infrastructure on AWS and Azure and use IaC to define it (Terraform, CloudFormation). For the most part our backend services are deployed as containers (ECS, Kubernetes) and are written in TypeScript and Node.js. You’ll also find a few services which use Python, C#, and Java, as well as some serverless deployments. For the front end of our application, we’ve built a responsive and accessible SPA with Angular 9 (Webpack, PostCSS) which is deployed and hosted on a CDN. Microsoft Power Platform is used for rapid development and deployment. Everything we build has several levels of automated testing and gets released through our CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins). About the role You will be part of a small team who has responsibility for the success of our products at For The Record. You and the team will need to take customer feedback and stakeholder input, distill that into the product direction then build that future. Developers have the autonomy to make the technical and architectural choices to achieve a great level of reliability, efficiency, security and maintainability across the backend of the product. On the front end, alongside our design team you’ll be focused on usability, accessibility, and performance. We require our developers to QA, test, and release all changes to the product themselves, which can include communication with internal stakeholders inside FTR. Our product teams also act as the last line of support on the products that they build. The final key responsibility is supporting each other. We expect all our developers to relish the opportunity to spread their knowledge and support and mentor other team members. We require everyone to be involved in the review process on each other’s work. About you More than any specific technology and experience the key things you will need to succeed at FTR is the ability to take initiative, set direction, work out yourself what needs to be done, and follow through on it. We focus on supporting each other rather than supervision so you will need to be able to work towards a goal without someone else telling you how to get there. At the same time, we know that none of us can be a silo or get everything done ourselves. Our success is dependent on everyone in the team. As part of a team, you will need to be able to participate actively in design and architecture, be willing to mentor, handle that not every proposal you make will be adopted, and treat everyone in a kind and thoughtful way. Responsibilities: End to end ownership of backend services: Ideate, review design, build, code-review, test, load-test, launch, monitor performance Work with the product team to translate requirements into well-defined technical implementation Build highly scalable and available systems that are well tested and maintainable. Experiment with new technologies to make sure we can scale for the future. Define technical and operational critical metrics to measure health Requirements: BS or MS in Computer Science/Engineering 7+ years of relevant software engineering experience Strong passion for automation, testing, and code quality Strong programming (Java,C# JSON and/or other related programming languages) Experience working with distributed databases (Azure highly preferred) For The Record provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Full Stack Developernew;For The Record;USA;Los Angeles, CA;None;None;Full Stack Software Developer About us For The Record (FTR) manages every step to capture, produce, and deliver timely and reliable court records. It’s the complete package for recording confidence and provides both in person and virtual court solutions. Our recording solution is currently installed in thousands of courtrooms in over 60 countries. We are currently developing new SaaS offerings that allow courts to securely store, index, play, and distribute their audio. In this evolving environment, providing access to remote justice has become a priority and our solution is poised to make an immediate impact. For The Record is a global organization based in the United States. We have development teams in the United States and Brisbane, Australia Our Tech and Tools Our tech stack is ever evolving and is chosen by developers working on the product. We like to keep our toolchain modern, but at the same time we don’t immediately rush to bleeding edge tech. We host our infrastructure on AWS and Azure and use IaC to define it (Terraform, CloudFormation). For the most part our backend services are deployed as containers (ECS, Kubernetes) and are written in TypeScript and Node.js. You’ll also find a few services which use Python, C#, and Java, as well as some serverless deployments. For the front end of our application, we’ve built a responsive and accessible SPA with Angular 9 (Webpack, PostCSS) which is deployed and hosted on a CDN. Microsoft Power Platform is used for rapid development and deployment. Everything we build has several levels of automated testing and gets released through our CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins). About the role You will be part of a small team who has responsibility for the success of our products at For The Record. You and the team will need to take customer feedback and stakeholder input, distill that into the product direction then build that future. Developers have the autonomy to make the technical and architectural choices to achieve a great level of reliability, efficiency, security and maintainability across the backend of the product. On the front end, alongside our design team you’ll be focused on usability, accessibility, and performance. We require our developers to QA, test, and release all changes to the product themselves, which can include communication with internal stakeholders inside FTR. Our product teams also act as the last line of support on the products that they build. The final key responsibility is supporting each other. We expect all our developers to relish the opportunity to spread their knowledge and support and mentor other team members. We require everyone to be involved in the review process on each other’s work. About you More than any specific technology and experience the key things you will need to succeed at FTR is the ability to take initiative, set direction, work out yourself what needs to be done, and follow through on it. We focus on supporting each other rather than supervision so you will need to be able to work towards a goal without someone else telling you how to get there. At the same time, we know that none of us can be a silo or get everything done ourselves. Our success is dependent on everyone in the team. As part of a team, you will need to be able to participate actively in design and architecture, be willing to mentor, handle that not every proposal you make will be adopted, and treat everyone in a kind and thoughtful way. Responsibilities: End to end ownership of backend services: Ideate, review design, build, code-review, test, load-test, launch, monitor performance Work with the product team to translate requirements into well-defined technical implementation Build highly scalable and available systems that are well tested and maintainable. Experiment with new technologies to make sure we can scale for the future. Define technical and operational critical metrics to measure health Requirements: BS or MS in Computer Science/Engineering 7+ years of relevant software engineering experience Strong passion for automation, testing, and code quality Strong programming (Java,C# JSON and/or other related programming languages) Experience working with distributed databases (Azure highly preferred) For The Record provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics. In addition to federal law requirements, For The Record complies with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the company has facilities. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training.

Senior Android Engineernew;Square;USA;San Francisco, CA 94103 (South of Market area);None;None;Company Description We believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. So we’re building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all. We started with a little white credit card reader but haven’t stopped there. Our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and NFC payments, and our Cash app lets people pay each other back instantly. We’re empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location. Let’s shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. We’re here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.  Job Description Within Square’s Seller team, we value (and practice) deep collaboration between teams and disciplines. You’ll work with engineers across the organization to implement solutions to problems with direct impact on our customers. You’ll work regularly with product managers and designers to ensure we’re shipping the right things to our sellers and iterating based on their feedback. Working within Seller Android is a unique opportunity in the mobile industry – you’ll get to work in one of the largest most established mobile ecosystems in existence – learning a lot from our team of 100+ Android engineers in the process. Invoices https://squareup.com/us/en/invoices The Invoices team helps Square merchants manage their customer workflow and get paid remotely. We facilitate the merchant's relationship with their customers by providing them with the ability to send Estimates and collect payments through invoicing and our recurring billing platform. As a member of the Invoices mobile team, you will work within Square’s Point of Sale codebase and have the ability to impact all of the apps in our ecosystem including our standalone Invoices app. Payments Acceptance Mobile Payment Acceptance Mobile builds SDKs for developers that build applications which take payments via Square – either talking to Square hardware via our Reader SDK, storing a card in buyer facing applications via our In-App Payments SDK, or using Square Point of Sale via our app-switch API. We work closely with both the Checkout Flow team, the Connected Device Experience team, and the Mobile Security team to create, package, and document the code that Square uses in our applications into ergonomic and simple SDKs that handle the complexities of taking card payments. As part of the Payment Acceptance Mobile team, you'll be building SDKs that not only serve Square's products, but also independent and professionally developed applications that Square wouldn't build. You'll bring the same product quality focus from Square products to building developer tools and libraries that allow our customers to never miss a sale. Square Point of Sale https://squareup.com/us/en/software/point-of-sale The Square Point of Sale team owns Square’s flagship product. When you go into a coffee shop and sign with your finger on an iPad or Square Register, you’re using Square Point of Sale. We have the privilege of building tools that help millions of sellers do their job every day. The Point of Sale team team focuses on building features that work for sellers of all sizes and business types – from the plumber down the street, to your local flower shop, to the multi-store coffee shop with 10s or even 100s of employees. The hardware that Point of Sale runs on is designed to match this diversity – our features work on everything from an iPhone up to our own Square Register hardware, and everything in between. As an engineer on the Point of Sale team you’ll be working closely with Squares from many disciplines on a regular basis: Your product manager to help define the team roadmap and features, your designer to get every pixel and interaction just right, to engineers outside of your team and org to help them ship their features, or to finish shipping yours. UI Systems UI Systems is building Square’s universal design system. This new design system will be deployed across all of Square’s seller facing products on iOS, Android and web, plus promote our public marketing website. This includes our flagship products Point of Sale, Square Register, and Square Terminal. Put simply, this team is building the new public face of Square. We’re not only building a design system, though: our mandate is wider than that. UI Systems is also building the core UI frameworks and tools needed to make building, testing, and maintaining UI easy and fast at scale: we’re supporting nearly 200 mobile engineers (and growing!) with our work across Android and iOS. Why are we doing this? As Square grows, ensuring a consistent experience across many products becomes a larger and larger challenge. At Square, we value great and consistent design – UI Systems is here to ensure that Square’s customers and Square engineers alike have a delightful and consistent experience when working with, or working on our products – no matter who built them.  Qualifications You’ll need to… Be proficient in Java and/or Kotlin for development (we use both). Enjoy working on mobile apps at all levels – from networking up to user interfaces and whatever’s in between. Build high availability and highly resilient systems which can accept and report payments no matter the network or device conditions. Collaborate with iOS, Android, and Server engineers to ship features. Work with product managers and designers to refine and define product scope and design. Respond to customer feedback to improve our products. Leveling & Promotions: Square has a robust program in place to ensure that as an engineer you’re always learning, growing, and increasing your impact within the company – regardless of if you’re a new college graduate, or a senior engineer with 10+ years of experience. If you want to learn more, check out this post on our engineering blog.  Additional Information At Square, our purpose is to empower – within and outside of our walls. In order to build the best tools for the businesses and customers we support all over the world, we have to start at home with a workforce as diverse and empowered as our sellers. To this end, we take great care to evaluate all employees and job applicants equally, based on merit, competence, and qualifications. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or any other characteristic protected by law. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply and always consider qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records, in accordance with the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us by sending an email to assistance(at)squareup.com.

Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. A passion for building user interfaces that augment our users' ability to work with data, and an understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.

Senior Android Engineernew;Square;USA;San Francisco, CA 94103 (South of Market area);None;None;Company Description We believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. So we’re building tools that make commerce easier and more accessible to all. We started with a little white credit card reader but haven’t stopped there. Our new reader helps our sellers accept chip cards and NFC payments, and our Cash app lets people pay each other back instantly. We’re empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location. Let’s shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. We’re here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.  Job Description Within Square’s Seller team, we value (and practice) deep collaboration between teams and disciplines. You’ll work with engineers across the organization to implement solutions to problems with direct impact on our customers. You’ll work regularly with product managers and designers to ensure we’re shipping the right things to our sellers and iterating based on their feedback. Working within Seller Android is a unique opportunity in the mobile industry – you’ll get to work in one of the largest most established mobile ecosystems in existence – learning a lot from our team of 100+ Android engineers in the process. Invoices https://squareup.com/us/en/invoices The Invoices team helps Square merchants manage their customer workflow and get paid remotely. We facilitate the merchant's relationship with their customers by providing them with the ability to send Estimates and collect payments through invoicing and our recurring billing platform. As a member of the Invoices mobile team, you will work within Square’s Point of Sale codebase and have the ability to impact all of the apps in our ecosystem including our standalone Invoices app. Payments Acceptance Mobile Payment Acceptance Mobile builds SDKs for developers that build applications which take payments via Square – either talking to Square hardware via our Reader SDK, storing a card in buyer facing applications via our In-App Payments SDK, or using Square Point of Sale via our app-switch API. We work closely with both the Checkout Flow team, the Connected Device Experience team, and the Mobile Security team to create, package, and document the code that Square uses in our applications into ergonomic and simple SDKs that handle the complexities of taking card payments. As part of the Payment Acceptance Mobile team, you'll be building SDKs that not only serve Square's products, but also independent and professionally developed applications that Square wouldn't build. You'll bring the same product quality focus from Square products to building developer tools and libraries that allow our customers to never miss a sale. Square Point of Sale https://squareup.com/us/en/software/point-of-sale The Square Point of Sale team owns Square’s flagship product. When you go into a coffee shop and sign with your finger on an iPad or Square Register, you’re using Square Point of Sale. We have the privilege of building tools that help millions of sellers do their job every day. The Point of Sale team team focuses on building features that work for sellers of all sizes and business types – from the plumber down the street, to your local flower shop, to the multi-store coffee shop with 10s or even 100s of employees. The hardware that Point of Sale runs on is designed to match this diversity – our features work on everything from an iPhone up to our own Square Register hardware, and everything in between. As an engineer on the Point of Sale team you’ll be working closely with Squares from many disciplines on a regular basis: Your product manager to help define the team roadmap and features, your designer to get every pixel and interaction just right, to engineers outside of your team and org to help them ship their features, or to finish shipping yours. UI Systems UI Systems is building Square’s universal design system. This new design system will be deployed across all of Square’s seller facing products on iOS, Android and web, plus promote our public marketing website. This includes our flagship products Point of Sale, Square Register, and Square Terminal. Put simply, this team is building the new public face of Square. We’re not only building a design system, though: our mandate is wider than that. UI Systems is also building the core UI frameworks and tools needed to make building, testing, and maintaining UI easy and fast at scale: we’re supporting nearly 200 mobile engineers (and growing!) with our work across Android and iOS. Why are we doing this? As Square grows, ensuring a consistent experience across many products becomes a larger and larger challenge. At Square, we value great and consistent design – UI Systems is here to ensure that Square’s customers and Square engineers alike have a delightful and consistent experience when working with, or working on our products – no matter who built them.  Qualifications You’ll need to… Be proficient in Java and/or Kotlin for development (we use both). Enjoy working on mobile apps at all levels – from networking up to user interfaces and whatever’s in between. Build high availability and highly resilient systems which can accept and report payments no matter the network or device conditions. Collaborate with iOS, Android, and Server engineers to ship features. Work with product managers and designers to refine and define product scope and design. Respond to customer feedback to improve our products. Leveling & Promotions: Square has a robust program in place to ensure that as an engineer you’re always learning, growing, and increasing your impact within the company – regardless of if you’re a new college graduate, or a senior engineer with 10+ years of experience. If you want to learn more, check out this post on our engineering blog.  Additional Information At Square, our purpose is to empower – within and outside of our walls. In order to build the best tools for the businesses and customers we support all over the world, we have to start at home with a workforce as diverse and empowered as our sellers. To this end, we take great care to evaluate all employees and job applicants equally, based on merit, competence, and qualifications. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or any other characteristic protected by law. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply and always consider qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records, in accordance with the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us by sending an email to assistance(at)squareup.com. We will treat your request as confidentially as possible. In your email, please include your name and preferred method of contact, and we will respond as soon as possible.
