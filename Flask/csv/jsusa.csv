Frontend Engineernew;eBay Inc.;USA;San Jose, CA;None;None;Love frontend development? Love open source? Love eBay? We believe you’ll love eBayUI! eBayUI, as you may have guessed, is the official frontend platform team of eBay. The eBayUI team is responsible for a number of different tools that are used across hundreds of web applications at eBay — and many of these tools are open source, including including Marko, CoreUI, Skin and MIND Patterns. We are specifically looking for a talented Engineer to help contribute to the next generation of the Marko platform. If much of this describes you, we’d love for you to join us. You’re an expert in the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS) and you know the frontend ecosystem. When working on the platform, the fundamentals are… fundamental. And knowing the web ecosystem helps make sure our decisions aren’t made in a vacuum. Plus, we’re always looking for tools that could make our lives easier (and we don’t need to build ourselves!). Additionally, many teams look to us for advice on architecture/techniques/solutions and not just related to the tools we develop. You care about accessibility and are familiar with accessibility principles and techniques. When designing our tools and APIs we need to ensure that we aren’t inhibiting our developers’ ability to build accessible products. We need to keep keyboard, screen-reader & other assistive technology users in mind. We strive to make all components accessible by default. You’re knowledgeable of web development techniques like responsive design and progressive improvement. The components and tools we’re building are used across many different products in different browsers and on different devices. Performance matters to you. You have a good understanding of CS fundamentals (like algorithmic complexity), how modern JS engines work, and performance techniques specific to the web. We want teams to be able to focus on building an exceptional product, not having to spend an inordinate amount of time optimizing things because the platform is consuming a significant portion of their performance budget. You’re comfortable reading others’ code and quickly making sense of things. If a user is having an issue with one of our tools, sometimes the easiest thing is to clone down their repo, take a look, and help them do what’s needed or determine if there’s something we need to address. We also write integrations with other open-source tools, and even for tools that have phenomenal end-user docs, the plugin API docs can be… sparse. Being able to parse the code and find the right hooks is often necessary. You like to share what you’re working on and what you’re learning with others. We work with teams all across the company, so good communication is key. Periodically we host “Brown Bag” talks to update developers on what’s new in the platform. With many of our projects being open source, we’re also working to sustain and grow the communities around these projects. We encourage pursuing outside speaking opportunities at conferences and meetups, as well as sharing ideas on the eBay tech blog and other mediums. We use the following tools, so experience in these or similar tools is a plus. Marko (similar: React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) Less (similar: Sass, Stylus) Git + GitHub (similar: GitLab, BitBucket) npm TravisCI (similar: CircleCI, Jenkins) Mocha/Jest (similar: Ava, Tape) Webdriver/Selenium (similar: puppeteer, playwright) Testing Library TypeScript Babel Lasso/Webpack/Rollup This website uses cookies to enhance your experience.

Many of our new initiatives eventually become standard across the industry, and we have thus established an unrivaled reputation as being a thought-leader in our industry.  Role & Responsibilities  Labatt’s developers create and continuously improve all the systems that run the business. Software and data analytics play a huge part in the success of the company, and therefore software developers have a significant impact on the company. Since the very beginning, Labatt has focused on writing all of its own code, allowing the company to move quickly into new areas and be flexible to customer needs. Our team of software developers design, test, and continually re-engineer the critical systems that keep all aspects of the business running at full steam.

Our philosophy of investing in clean code and developing people from within allows us to build for the long term and leverage the most forward-thinking APIs, languages, and practices, to take on the most intellectually challenging projects that our industry faces.  As a software developer at Labatt, you will take on projects approximately 6 months in length, iterate on a small team of 3-5, test thoroughly, design clean & modular code, experiment, learn, be challenged, and serve the needs of the business. All developers are expected to contribute to the team's success by solving non-trivial problems and sharing lessons learned with the group. Developers are also expected to follow the group's established coding and process best practices as established by the group to ensure quality and consistent code - code that will last for many years.

Javascript Developer;Silverfin;USA;Remote;None;None;"If you’re any good at Javascript, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-recruitment@silverfin.com.  Ahum. Here it comes. What’s a Silverfin? At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.  The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in. What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special? We’re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring in this regard, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.  Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.  Being remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!  We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #dev channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments. What does working at Silverfin look like? We work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people.  You’ll be supported by our UI designer who develops and maintains HTML and CSS components into a reusable UI-framework, and can also build Vue.js prototypes when necessary. You’ll often work together with them to tweak the look and feel before deploying new features and changes. For the more complex features we’ll often write a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) first so the product team can do usability tests with real users. This allows us to validate the assumptions we make during product design.  We use Vue.js, vanilla JS and a bit of jQuery for the interactive parts of our application, and an up-to-date Rails monolith for the backend. Rails also renders the html for the less interactive parts of the application. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice.  No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.  Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you should issues arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.  Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 7TB*, and our largest table recently crossed the 10 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.  : Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?  What does your future look like? Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to get promoted. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.  Everyone has a €1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation and travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. What are we looking for? You have at least 3 years of professional experience in Javascript. You have some experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough. You also have experience using Rails and have used it as an api as well as for rendering HTML. You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls. You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development. You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally. You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as separation of concerns. You're aware of the trade-offs involved in engineering, product design, as well as the bigger “business” picture. You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary. Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h) Nice to have’s These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you. Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team An eye for detail Experience in UI/UX design Experience in Fintech Basic understanding of accounting What can we offer you? Actual, proper work-life balance Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely Personal growth training and opportunities Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues A €1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills Interested?

Senior Frontend Software Engineer;Labelbox;USA;San Francisco, CA 94110 (Mission area);None;None;About Labelbox  Labelbox is building software infrastructure for industrial data science teams to do data labeling for the training of neural networks. When we build software, we take for granted the existence of collaborative tools to write and debug code. The machine learning workflow has no standard tooling for labeling data, storing it, debugging models and then continually improving model accuracy. Enter Labelbox. Labelbox's vision is to become the default software for data scientists to manage data and train neural networks in the same way that GitHub or text editors are defaults for software engineers.  We are backed by some of the finest people in the Silicon Valley who work at Andreessen Horowitz, Gradient Ventures (Google's AI fund), Kleiner Perkins and First Round Capital. Responsibilities Strong understanding of Javascript with an interest in using Typescript Build component driven applications with ReactJS Experience working with Redux and architecting large single page applications Experience in frontend testing Experience making design docs for data rich web applications Deep understanding of browser APIs Follow-on Responsibilities Using canvas to build highly performant labeling interfaces Building new features and resolvers in our GraphQL API with Node.JS Experience with SQL databases Experience optimizing web traffic Requirements 4+ years of experience building data rich frontend web applications A bachelor’s degree (or equivalent experience) in computer science or a related field. We believe that AI has the power to transform every aspect of our lives - from healthcare to agriculture. The exponential impact of artificial intelligence will mean mammograms can happen quickly and cheaply irrespective of the limited number of radiologists there are in the world and growers will know the instant that disease hits their farm without even being there.  At Labelbox, we’re building a platform to accelerate the development of this future. Rather than requiring companies to create their own expensive and incomplete homegrown tools, we’ve created a training data platform that acts as a central hub for humans to interface with AI. When humans have better ways to input and manage data, machines have better ways to learn.

Clojure Software Developer;Cisco Systems;USA;Austin, TX 78727;None;None;What You'll Do Cisco is looking for a talented data engineer to join our Threat Response software development team. We use Clojure to mesh large volumes of high dimensional network, host and service information with taxonomic information about malicious software. Much of our work involves understanding and reasoning about this data, which describes the behavior of adversarial actors in complex systems. We use this data to help our customers understand the nature of the threat they face, and to determine the best course of action. Consequently, there is a lot of room to explore and apply cutting edge software development skills in a practical, useful, fascinating, expansive, and evolving problem domain. The overarching goal is to provide tools that benefit the security of our customers’ infrastructure.  Who You’ll Work With Our Threat Response team is distributed across North America and Europe. We work mostly from home and occasionally come in to the office, if necessary. We prize verbal and written communication skills, sociability, and pride in carrying out duties with speed and precision. Our developers make a major global impact. We draw on the best of agile themes and techniques from the past 30 years: continuous integration and deployment, testing, flexible collaboration with globally distributed team members via chat and video, and gradual, deliberate optimization of process in the name of keeping projects and releases flowing smoothly. We provide an excellent, continuously evolving product to our customers. We are surrounded by talented QA, UX, support, documentation writers, and management. We hold ourselves to high standards.

Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Senior Software Engineer, Full Stack;Poynt Co.;USA;Palo Alto, CA 94303 (Charleston Gardens area);None;None;In 2013, our founding team recognized the lack of smart terminals in the market, so we set about reimagining the ubiquitous payment terminal into a connected, multi-purpose device that runs third-party apps. As smart terminals become mainstream, Poynt OS sets the standard as the open operating system that can power any smart payment terminal worldwide. Combined with our Apps ecosystem we are creating a new app economy for merchants and allowing developers to write once and distribute everywhere. Fueling our growth are some of the Valley’s top VC firms and leading global payments and fintech companies including Elavon, Google Ventures, Matrix Partners, National Australia Bank, NYCA Partners, Oak HC/FT Partners, Stanford-StartX Fund, and Webb Investment Network. We’ve raised over $130M as of 2019. Headquartered in the heart of Silicon Valley in Palo Alto, CA, with offices in India and Singapore, we’re growing rapidly on a global scale so that merchants worldwide have the technology to transform their business. About the Role At Poynt, our goal is to give our merchants superpowers to run every aspect of their business. Beyond just accepting payments on their Poynt terminal, we want them to leverage Poynt to improve their sales, to engage with their customers, and to make day-to-day operations as smooth as possible. No matter where the merchant is located, no matter what industry they are in, no matter how many stores they have – we want them to have the best possible experience so they can focus on what matters most: growing their own business and making their employees and customers happy.

Mission Control, an enterprise application used by our bank and reseller partners, developer partners, and large merchants to manage a large number of stores and a whole fleet of payment terminals. This is the B2B side of our web product, and important factors are optimal information density, useful data visualizations, and a strong user permissions model. Web apps that run on the Poynt terminal to let merchants perform many important functions: manually enter a card number to take phone or online orders, update their product catalog on the fly, and order paper rolls and other accessories. Both fast iteration and fast load times are crucial for these apps, and so we spend time on our build toolchain, asset pipeline, and caching layer. A large number of internal tools for Poynt people and our Customer Success team to support our merchants and partners: mechanisms to surface issues and aggregate data in real-time, to evaluate the reliability of new OS and app builds during staged rollouts, and to make the support experience as smooth as possible through live chat and remote control of deployed Poynt terminals.
