Job_Description_Summary: PayPal's Global Credit Risk, Seller Risk and Collections (GCSC) team is looking to fill a critical leadership role on our Risk Intelligence team. This role will support and guide analytic efforts that help inform and drive strategic decisions as our suite of Consumer Credit and Merchant lending products expand globally. This highly visible and versatile role frequently engages with Risk and Credit Leadership, Consumer/Merchant teams, Finance, and Collections to understand the most challenging business problems we need to solve and provide answers to the “big questions” through a combination of routine reporting, monitoring, ad-hoc analytics and data story telling. As a senior analytics professional, you will manage the delivery of high quality monitoring and reporting solutions by managing the efforts of multiple business intelligence development teams. These efforts range from small, single stream initiatives to large-scale multi-stream efforts in a complex, fast-paced, dynamic environment. In this role, you will identify, translate, prioritize, and inform important questions with data. You will lead efforts to explore data to find actionable insights and make recommendations through funnels, cohort analyses, long-term trends, segmentation, and regression models, across key commercial and credit risk portfolio metrics. Together with the Business Intelligence development team and our Global Data Service (GDS) you will partner to create simple, trustworthy data pipelines and build automated reporting to surface key metrics. Your team will leverage a combination of tools and technologies used across the enterprise (e.g. Qlik, SQL, Tableau, etc.…) to develop and maintain a suite of Risk Intelligence monitoring and reporting solutions to support our most senior Risk executives. As a key thought leader, you will recommend new performance monitoring metrics and/or changes to existing metric frameworks ensuring what we measure stays relevant for our evolving Credit business. You will work with leadership to maintain an active roadmap of analytic projects and help guide the evolution and maturation of our Risk Intelligence BI and Analytics solutions framework. You and your team will own and manage the business intelligence demand intake (request) and prioritization (governance) process across a variety of internal stakeholders and oversee the delivery efforts for active projects. While your primary role is to lead the efforts of others, you must be comfortable with being both player (at times) and coach. When required, you must possess the ability and willingness to “roll up your sleeves” to help perform analytical deep dives to identify problems, opportunities, and outline specific action plans. As a Manager, you will lead, guide, mentor, and develop a team of talented data architects, analysts, and BI developers to build dashboards and analytic solutions that answer the big questions and help monitor and measure the success of our growth and the health of our Credit portfolio(s). You will guide and influence the UI/UX design of our analytic solutions to ensure consistency of user experience, ease of use, and best-in class design for data visualization. During active projects, you will help guide our internal clients through the requirements gathering and solution planning phases to formulate project scope, schedule, and resource requirements. You will help articulate both business and technical needs to our delivery teams including Data & Solutions Architecture, and our Global Data Service (GDS) partners. You will provide day to day project management, coordination of activities and communicate all key project status updates.

Associate Research Scholar (Data) Brown Institute;Python;USA;New York, NY 10027 (Manhattanville area);Columbia University;;;"The David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation was founded in 2012 and is a joint effort between Stanford’s School of Engineering and Columbia Journalism School (CJS). Each year, the Brown Institute awards close to $1M in grants and fellowships to foster new tools and modes of expression, and to create stories that escape the bounds of page and screen. We are committed to radical experimentation with the potential to define new priorities and practices for both engineering and journalism. The Brown Institute at CJS is seeking a Research Scholar (open rank) to serve as a data specialist in support the Institute’s research and grants. This person will play both a high-level role reporting directly to the Director of the Institute at Columbia, helping provide data expertise and assistance to the Institute’s various grant and fellowship programs, as well as assisting in the implementation of seminars and workshops that engage the CJS and Columbia University (CU) communities in data-related topics. The primary function of the Institute is to serve as a grant making organization. As such, the Institute has funded over 50 projects, supporting well over 150 grantees and fellows. Due to our position as a joint venture between Stanford Engineering and Columbia Journalism School, as well as seismic shifts in the journalism industry that have led many organizations to focus heavily on data and computation, many of our projects are rooted in data-based storytelling. In our 2019-2020 Magic Grant cycle alone, the Brown Institute at Columbia is explicitly supporting three projects that are essentially database research endeavours. One project, for example, is focused on acquiring and aggregating human rights violations in Pakistan to enable better reporting on the country. Another project is focused on producing a comprehensive database of maternal deaths in Nigeria, as well as providing systematic assessment of the efficacy of health interventions in the country. And yet another project is developing an automated database of the Trump administration’s 3000+ current and former appointees, enabling journalists to report on stories about appointees’ interests and potential conflicts, and how those impact policymaking. The Research Scholar will be the lead data scientist for these projects — creating databases from possibly unstructured information; designing systems for the ingest, automation, and cleaning of future data; and helping journalists pull stories from the data. In addition to grants and fellowships, the Institute offers a number of pedagogical programs, from simple open office hours on topics like Data Visualization and Mapping, to seminars and conferences about the role of data in journalism. The Research Scholar will have the opportunity to assist in these efforts, helping design and lead workshops, provide office hours to the school, and work on personal projects that align with the mission of the Institute. This is an exciting new role that will leverage the incredible grants we have funded, as well as our connections to industry and to the academic environment in which we exist. These tasks mean that the Research Scholar should have a firm grounding in all things data. Applicants should be fluent in at least one programming language, preferably Python or R, and should have a history of learning new technological platforms as well as a general curiosity about how technology might shape narrative. The Research Scholar will also be encouraged to seek out and develop their own novel data projects, and might also teach a course in the CJS, with the goal of promoting the mix of data and journalism in new ways. This position will be appointed for up to 12 months, may be renewable contingent on performance and the continued availability of funding.   Minimum Degree Required Bachelor’s Degree required   Minimum Qualifications Experience with data and computation, and fluency in a programming language   Preferred Qualifications Advanced degree preferred   Additional Information Other Skills: Has ability to work easily with teams of journalists and other members of the Brown Institute and the CJS community. Should be familiar with current technological innovations in one or more of the following areas: visualization, physical computing, app development, game design, general data and computer science, and computational media. An appreciation for the power of a good story and the ability to experiment with the technical means of its production are key.

Postdoc research opportunity in unraveling earthquake cycle...;Python;USA;La Cañada Flintridge, CA 91011;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;;;Job Details Job ID: 11225  Getting a better understanding of why and when earthquakes occur requires a better understanding of all the processes involved in the earthquake cycle. In the past two decades, repeating Slow Slip Events (SSEs) have been found to occur in subduction zones. Like devastating earthquake, SSEs release energy through shearing of the tectonic plates, but at rates much slower than earthquakes. While not dangerous in themselves, SSEs do change the local stress field and can have implications for earthquake triggering.  Responsibilities  We seek a postdoc to use time-dependent remote sensing data sets that advance our understanding of lithospheric processes and in addition study the impact on critical infrastructure. Prior experience in either large-scale time-series InSAR processing (e.g., GIAnT or StaMPS), InSAR ionospheric/tropospheric noise corrections (e.g., PyAPS, TRAIN, or split spectrum ionospheric corrections), integration of GNSS and InSAR datasets, or inverse modeling of long-wavelength tectonic processes such as interseismic deformation, creep, and slow slip is strongly recommended. Dr. David Bekaert will serve as the postdoctoral advisor. The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, resulting in publications in the open literature.  Qualifications  Candidates must have a recent PhD in a related field and should have good programming experience in Matlab and Python. C++ is considered an advantage. Candidates who have received their PhD within the past five years since the date of their application are eligible. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years.

Software Engineer Intern;Python;USA;Berkeley, CA;Anyscale;;;About Anyscale Anyscale provides an application development platform for developers to build distributed applications. We’re commercializing a popular open source project called Ray, which is a framework for distributed computing as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning. Our goal is to build a standardized platform for distributed computing. Ray was developed at UC Berkeley by Robert Nishihara and Philipp Moritz, under the guidance of Ion Stoica and Michael Jordan, and the four of them have co-founded Anyscale. The company raised a $20.6M Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) with participation from NEA, Intel Capital, Ant Financial, Amplify Partners, 11.2 Capital, and The House Fund.  With Ray, we're making it easy to program at any scale (from your laptop to the datacenter) by providing easy-to-use, general-purpose, and high-performance tools. In addition, we are building a rich ecosystem of libraries (for reinforcement learning, hyperparameter search, experiment management, machine learning training, prediction serving, and more) on top of the core distributed system so that users can rapidly build sophisticated applications. Help us build the future of software development.  We are looking for passionate, motivated people who are excited to build tools to power the next generation of cloud applications.  We are hiring strong software engineers for a variety of roles. Examples include:  Distributed systems engineering. Today, engineers working on scalable applications repeatedly solve the same problems over and over like scheduling tasks, handling machine failures, and transferring data efficiently. Build the next generation of tools and infrastructure to make developing and running distributed applications in the cloud as easy as on your laptop. Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray. This work will allow programmers to develop applications much more rapidly and at a much higher level of abstraction.  Scalable machine learning libraries. One of the things that makes Python great is the fact that it has great libraries. Developers can import numpy and pandas and start building powerful applications. But in the distributed setting today, we don’t have libraries. Instead, we have distributed systems like Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. For example, an online learning system that ingests streaming data, incrementally trains new recommendation models, and then serves recommendations to users will have to stitch together three different distributed systems (one for streaming, one for training, and one for serving) just to build a single application. In the future, people will build these kinds of applications by importing powerful distributed libraries from a rich ecosystem and by composing them together to build new applications. Help us build that ecosystem. This will include libraries for reinforcement learning, hyperparameter tuning, experiment management, model serving, distributed training, and more. Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray.  Frontend engineering. Developing scalable distributed applications is notoriously difficult, and debugging these applications is even worse. By exposing the right metrics and visualizations, providing high levels of observability into the underlying system and application behavior, and allowing users to take appropriate actions through the product frontend, we can make the experience of developing, running, and debugging software vastly more efficient and delightful.  We are looking for senior hires as well as less experienced but motivated individuals. As part of your role you will: Develop high quality software to empower software developers and simplify programming Work with a team of leading distributed systems and machine learning experts Communicate your work to a broader audience through talks, tutorials, and blog posts Help us to build and shape a world class company Must be willing to work onsite in our Berkeley, CA office.

Associate Research Scholar (Data) Brown Institute;Python;USA;New York, NY 10027 (Manhattanville area);Columbia University;;;"The David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation was founded in 2012 and is a joint effort between Stanford’s School of Engineering and Columbia Journalism School (CJS). Each year, the Brown Institute awards close to $1M in grants and fellowships to foster new tools and modes of expression, and to create stories that escape the bounds of page and screen. We are committed to radical experimentation with the potential to define new priorities and practices for both engineering and journalism. The Brown Institute at CJS is seeking a Research Scholar (open rank) to serve as a data specialist in support the Institute’s research and grants. This person will play both a high-level role reporting directly to the Director of the Institute at Columbia, helping provide data expertise and assistance to the Institute’s various grant and fellowship programs, as well as assisting in the implementation of seminars and workshops that engage the CJS and Columbia University (CU) communities in data-related topics. The primary function of the Institute is to serve as a grant making organization. As such, the Institute has funded over 50 projects, supporting well over 150 grantees and fellows. Due to our position as a joint venture between Stanford Engineering and Columbia Journalism School, as well as seismic shifts in the journalism industry that have led many organizations to focus heavily on data and computation, many of our projects are rooted in data-based storytelling. In our 2019-2020 Magic Grant cycle alone, the Brown Institute at Columbia is explicitly supporting three projects that are essentially database research endeavours. One project, for example, is focused on acquiring and aggregating human rights violations in Pakistan to enable better reporting on the country. Another project is focused on producing a comprehensive database of maternal deaths in Nigeria, as well as providing systematic assessment of the efficacy of health interventions in the country. And yet another project is developing an automated database of the Trump administration’s 3000+ current and former appointees, enabling journalists to report on stories about appointees’ interests and potential conflicts, and how those impact policymaking. The Research Scholar will be the lead data scientist for these projects — creating databases from possibly unstructured information; designing systems for the ingest, automation, and cleaning of future data; and helping journalists pull stories from the data. In addition to grants and fellowships, the Institute offers a number of pedagogical programs, from simple open office hours on topics like Data Visualization and Mapping, to seminars and conferences about the role of data in journalism. The Research Scholar will have the opportunity to assist in these efforts, helping design and lead workshops, provide office hours to the school, and work on personal projects that align with the mission of the Institute. This is an exciting new role that will leverage the incredible grants we have funded, as well as our connections to industry and to the academic environment in which we exist. These tasks mean that the Research Scholar should have a firm grounding in all things data. Applicants should be fluent in at least one programming language, preferably Python or R, and should have a history of learning new technological platforms as well as a general curiosity about how technology might shape narrative. The Research Scholar will also be encouraged to seek out and develop their own novel data projects, and might also teach a course in the CJS, with the goal of promoting the mix of data and journalism in new ways. This position will be appointed for up to 12 months, may be renewable contingent on performance and the continued availability of funding.   Minimum Degree Required Bachelor’s Degree required   Minimum Qualifications Experience with data and computation, and fluency in a programming language   Preferred Qualifications Advanced degree preferred   Additional Information Other Skills: Has ability to work easily with teams of journalists and other members of the Brown Institute and the CJS community. Should be familiar with current technological innovations in one or more of the following areas: visualization, physical computing, app development, game design, general data and computer science, and computational media. An appreciation for the power of a good story and the ability to experiment with the technical means of its production are key.

Software Engineer, Admissions;Python;USA;San Francisco, CA 94108 (Chinatown area);Y Combinator;;;What We Do:  Y Combinator (YC) is a startup fund and program. Since 2005, YC has invested in over 2,000 companies including Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, Instacart, and Docker. These companies are now worth over $155B combined. YC has built programs that support founders throughout the life of their company. Many of our services were created by YC alumni who later became YC partners — so, we understand the challenges involved with building a company. We help founders navigate their biggest challenges — from learning how to start a company, to finding customers, to raising funding and hiring their first employees, to raising a Series A and scaling beyond.  About the role:  Twice a year, we receive tens of thousands of applications from promising startups all around the world. Reviewing these applications is one of the most important aspects of YC’s business. While fundamentally a technical role, promising candidates should also be excellent communicators, proactively seek out strategic opportunities to improve processes, and be open to doing non-technical tasks like reviewing applications and interviewing startups.  In this role, you will support efforts in the following domains:  > Build new admissions software features > Conduct exploratory analysis on admissions data to inform strategic decision making. > Collaborate with software engineering to maintain and extend existing data infrastructure. > Develop internal tools for parsing unstructured data. > Review startup applications and interviewing founders  We’re looking for someone with:  > Interest in fields at the intersection of computer science / psychology / social science > Strong software experience, ideally in Ruby/Rails and Python. > 1+ years of software engineering experience. > Good communication skills (written/verbal). > An interest in startups  The ideal candidate is self-motivated, independent, and passionate about using data to answer interesting questions to find promising founders and make YC the best experience for them. Strong candidates will be comfortable with handling a diverse set of tasks - from modeling the expected number of applications in a given batch to building the software that handles those applications, to actually reviewing them.  We are looking for someone senior enough to know best practices, but still excited to get their hands dirty. YC started as a family business, and we look for low-ego people who prioritize getting the job done over tool or title.  This is a good job for someone who is excited about startups and interested in learning more about them. You’ve likely worked at or started a startup, or want to do so in the future.  Location & Benefits:  The YC admissions team is based in downtown SF. We can help you move here, but don't hire people who can only work remotely.  We offer highly competitive compensation (even with the top tech companies in the valley) and even equity in YC. We also offer full benefits that you might expect from established companies, including top healthcare benefits, 401k matching, generous parental leave, commuter benefits, catered lunch, and a flexible vacation policy. 30+ days ago report job

(Remote) Software Engineer;Python;USA;San Francisco, CA;VotingWorks;;;A BIT ABOUT US  VotingWorks is a non-partisan non-profit founded on the powerful idea that the operating system of our democracy should be publicly owned. Every citizen’s vote is sacred, and every citizen deserves evidence that our elections are free and fair.  Forty states use voting machines that are over ten years old. Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.  We’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America’s election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment.  THE OPPORTUNITY  We are builders. We don’t just believe in the publicly owned operating system of democracy, we’re building it. We believe in voting machines that delight voters, election officials, and security experts. And we’re building them. We believe election officials need the right software to audit their elections. And we’re building that, too. We’re building the tools to help the public gain confidence that our elections are run well.  If you’re like us, you’ve been thinking about the myriad problems and rough edges of our democracy for a while. We’ve decided that talking about it isn’t enough - we must do something.  THE TEAM  We work as a small, tight-knit team. We’re a flat organization when it comes to ideas and input, and we believe in good management, even as a small organization, so that every VotingWorks team member gets regular feedback, guidance, and an opportunity for tremendous personal growth. We strive to be both confident in the skills and knowledge we each bring and humble in our interactions with each other and other stakeholders in the election space.  THE ROLE  You’ll be writing code, reviewing code, reviewing product specs, contributing to product specs, working directly with voters, election officials, security experts, disability advocates, and more. Your code will help citizens cast and verify their votes.  We don’t work on hip but questionable ideas (ahem.. blockchain voting). We build high-reliability, well-tested and well-architected software that will stand the test of time. We know technology alone won’t fix it. We’re building code with empathy for voters, election officials, and the long history of the democratic process.  We’re looking for software engineers with 10+ years of professional software development and Web technology experience, ideally focused on backend and database. If you're a little bit shy of 10 years but you're particularly excited about the problems we're solving, do send us your resume.  THE STACK  We use Typescript, React, Node.js for the front-end, Python/Flask, PostgreSQL for the backend. We prefer if you know some of these technologies because we’re a small team, but if you don’t and you’re game to learn them, you should still send us your resume. We’re more interested in how well you understand Web technology and how much you love to learn and improve your skills than in your knowledge of specific programming languages or frameworks. If you prefer backend or frontend, that’s great – almost every engineer has a preference. We’re a small team, though, so you’ll get a chance to work across the stack – and we’ll almost certainly need you to. WITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU'LL contribute features to voting machine and/or verification software. WITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL contribute ideas to the entire architecture of our voting system take ownership of significant portions of our stack start to see your code help election officials and voters. WITHIN 12 MONTHS, YOU'LL be able to say that your code ran a real election in the United States, with many more to come. WE'RE FULLY DISTRIBUTED  We’re a fully distributed organization, which means that for most roles you can work from anywhere in the United States. We offer a flexible work schedule and we're on board with schedule flexibility: more than half of us have kids, and we enjoy attending their various sporting and non-sporting events. With flexibility comes responsibility: you should be comfortable with significant autonomous work.  COMPENSATION  We’re a non-profit, so we compensate in cash and benefits exclusively. We won’t pay you as much as a big for-profit, but we’ll still pay you a very fair salary and competitive benefits. Compensation is commensurate with your skills and experience.  WE'RE BUILDING A DIVERSE TEAM  We never discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, background, ability/disability or really anything that isn’t about your skills.  We strive to go beyond that: we want to build a diverse organization that truly represents the people of the United States of America.

Software Engineer;Python;USA;San Francisco, CA 94105 (South Beach area);Triplebyte;;;"About Triplebyte Triplebyte is transforming the way software engineers are hired. Our mission is to build an open, skills-based credential and network for all engineers. Millions of software engineering jobs are opened every year, but only so many engineers have degrees from high-end colleges or experience at selective startups. Our network highlights the skills engineers can bring to a job, regardless of their background, and allows companies to find these engineers through matching or Triplebyte Source. We have built a background-blind technical assessment and interview process, and we use it to find engineers and help them get jobs at 450+ top companies. Our rich understanding of candidates’ skills and propriety machine learning models enable us to find the right match between our candidates and partner companies. This is why companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte’s technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them. We recently raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 55 is excited to grow both our customer, and user base. You will have lots of opportunities for taking on responsibility and developing new skills quickly. Press Links You can read more about our company and hear from our founders in the press here: Triplebyte raises $35M for its online coding test and credentialing service for hiring engineers Triplebyte raises $35 million to match engineers with employers CNBC (Your Next Job Interview Could be with a Robot) Lessons from Doing Y Combinator Twice - Harj Taggar Building an Engineering Team - Harj Taggar and Ammon Bartram You can also read some case studies with a few of our partner companies like Box, Instacart, Mixpanel and Gusto and also learn more about us on our press page. We're an experienced team, the founders have each built and sold companies before. Ammon and Guillaume founded Socialcam (acquired by Autodesk for $60 million) and Harj was the first partner hired at Y Combinator since its founding. We are rapidly growing our engineering team, we are looking for generalist, full-stack, frontend, backend, machine learning, and dev-ops engineers! Building the best product The Triplebyte engineering team is still rather small, only 8 people. We all went through the Triplebyte process :) We move fast, release new features daily and iterate quickly. Triplebyte is growing very quickly and the engineering team is fully dedicated to supporting that growth, in any way we can. We are a generalist engineering team, we work on anything that helps the company or other teams grow. We cycle through backend, full-stack and frontend work based on the most critical needs. All of us are encouraged to work on all those parts. Our frontend is mostly in React/Redux. Our backend is in Ruby on Rails, Postgres and Redis. (We also use python with Tensorflow for all our data science work) It doesn't seem like it, but we have built a LOT of software. We are a truly full-stack company and we are building a process that needs to be perfect ends to ends. We have software for engineers, for interviewers, for writers, for companies, for us, etc.. If that's any indication of scale, we crossed recently the 200 tables in our Postgres database :) Join us and help us build the best product! We value initiative, productivity, and ownership. Compensation and Benefits Competitive salary and stock options package Open vacation policy Employer paid health, vision and dental insurance 401(k) plan with matching Pre-tax commuter benefits Daily catered lunches Our Mission We believe strongly in building a truly meritocratic, unbiased process for finding great talent. Even the best technology companies today still use where people went to college as a proxy for intelligence and ability. We're building a process that looks only at ability, not credentials, so we can have a future where everyone can focus on just learning and being good at what they do, not how they look on paper. Every aspect of running a company has been improved over the last decade, except hiring. Most decisions are still made using amorphous terms like ""gut feel"" or ""culture fit"". They should be made using crisp data. Only a company specializing on this problem, using data collected from the hiring process at hundreds of companies, can solve it. That's the company we're building. Our mission is creating a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently routing it to the best place. Starting with software engineers. The Company is an equal opportunity employer and makes employment decisions on the basis of merit and business needs. The Company does not discriminate against employees or applicants (in any aspect of employment, including, but not limited to recruiting and hiring, job assignment, compensation, opportunities for advancement, promotion, transfers, evaluation, benefits, training, discipline, and termination), on the basis of any characteristic protected under applicable federal, state, or local laws. 30+ days ago report job"

Developer Advocate - Bloomberg Quant Platform (BQuant);Python;USA;San Francisco, CA;Bloomberg;;;"Bloomberg is the global leader in business and financial data, news and insight. Using the power of technology, we connect the world’s decision makers to accurate information on the financial markets – and help them make faster, smarter decisions. So where does BQuant fit in? Finance is changing, and fast; new financial professionals are even learning python themselves. Here in our San Francisco office we’ve identified an opportunity to reach this tech savvy client base by building a product that opens our data, core products and visualizations to data scientists, ML researchers, and quantitative modelers. Gone are the days of downloading raw CSV files! The BQuant platform allows users to bring their algorithms to our data, not the other way around. Our service provides a unified environment where users can develop their code and test, share, and deploy it easily. Our impact? Providing the entire industry with tools that are currently only available to large banks and hedge funds, through customer deployed installations in enterprise environments. Who are our users? What are their challenges? Our users span the spectrum from experienced quant researchers, to financial professionals who are learning new programming skills for the first time. By providing our users a full Python programming environment that gives access to Bloomberg data and services, BQuant puts much more power and flexibility in their hands than ever before. However, this comes at a cost. The learning curve on the platform is steep! Our users need to learn how to programmatically access and manipulate Bloomberg’s myriad datasets, and they need to learn how to use new libraries for financial analysis and interactive visualizations. The learning curve is even steeper for those who are new to programming, or new to Python. In addition, given the inherent flexibility of a programming environment, it is easy to write code that performs suboptimally or is difficult to maintain. Our users need a way to easily learn and adopt best practices on the platform to avoid these pitfalls. We want to build a large community of new developers who can leverage the power BQuant provides. To do this, we need to learn how to engage with our users differently, to teach and equip them with a new set of skills, and help them become excited about and productive in BQuant as quickly as possible. We need to understand how they learn and what their common stumbling blocks are, and we need to generate excellent content and tools for their journey. That’s where you come in! As a developer advocate for BQuant, we’ll trust you to: Lead the mission to equip our users with new skills by driving and owning our technical content strategy Collaborate closely with multiple departments to understand our users’ workflows and to deeply understand BQuant’s features and library APIs, including best practices Write and maintain excellent developer tutorials and workflow templates Write and maintain guides to help our users navigate breaking changes in libraries Incorporate and teach best practices through the tutorials and resources on the platform Create videos and supplementary material to introduce users to new features or new workflows Review and standardize written or video content produced from other sources Advocate for our users: Collect feedback and influence product or marketing decisions to make our users as productive as possible in this new development environment You need to have: 2+ years of programming experience in Python A strong understanding of idiomatic Python and Python best practices A strong understanding of general programming best practices Excellent writing skills Strong collaboration and communication skills We’d love to see: Experience writing technical documentation Experience teaching, or an appreciation for pedagogical techniques An appreciation for how our data sets underpin the world's financial systems - if you don't know anything about finance, you'll pick it up by interacting with a world-class team of market experts.
