Associate Research Scholar (Data) Brown Institute;Python;USA;New York, NY 10027 (Manhattanville area);Columbia University;;;"Associate Research Scholar (Data) Brown Institute Columbia University1,061 reviews - New York, NY 10027 (Manhattanville area) Apply On Company Site The David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation was founded in 2012 and is a joint effort between Stanford’s School of Engineering and Columbia Journalism School (CJS). Each year, the Brown Institute awards close to $1M in grants and fellowships to foster new tools and modes of expression, and to create stories that escape the bounds of page and screen. We are committed to radical experimentation with the potential to define new priorities and practices for both engineering and journalism. The Brown Institute at CJS is seeking a Research Scholar (open rank) to serve as a data specialist in support the Institute’s research and grants. This person will play both a high-level role reporting directly to the Director of the Institute at Columbia, helping provide data expertise and assistance to the Institute’s various grant and fellowship programs, as well as assisting in the implementation of seminars and workshops that engage the CJS and Columbia University (CU) communities in data-related topics. The primary function of the Institute is to serve as a grant making organization. As such, the Institute has funded over 50 projects, supporting well over 150 grantees and fellows. Due to our position as a joint venture between Stanford Engineering and Columbia Journalism School, as well as seismic shifts in the journalism industry that have led many organizations to focus heavily on data and computation, many of our projects are rooted in data-based storytelling. In our 2019-2020 Magic Grant cycle alone, the Brown Institute at Columbia is explicitly supporting three projects that are essentially database research endeavours. One project, for example, is focused on acquiring and aggregating human rights violations in Pakistan to enable better reporting on the country. Another project is focused on producing a comprehensive database of maternal deaths in Nigeria, as well as providing systematic assessment of the efficacy of health interventions in the country. And yet another project is developing an automated database of the Trump administration’s 3000+ current and former appointees, enabling journalists to report on stories about appointees’ interests and potential conflicts, and how those impact policymaking. The Research Scholar will be the lead data scientist for these projects — creating databases from possibly unstructured information; designing systems for the ingest, automation, and cleaning of future data; and helping journalists pull stories from the data. In addition to grants and fellowships, the Institute offers a number of pedagogical programs, from simple open office hours on topics like Data Visualization and Mapping, to seminars and conferences about the role of data in journalism. The Research Scholar will have the opportunity to assist in these efforts, helping design and lead workshops, provide office hours to the school, and work on personal projects that align with the mission of the Institute. This is an exciting new role that will leverage the incredible grants we have funded, as well as our connections to industry and to the academic environment in which we exist. These tasks mean that the Research Scholar should have a firm grounding in all things data. Applicants should be fluent in at least one programming language, preferably Python or R, and should have a history of learning new technological platforms as well as a general curiosity about how technology might shape narrative. The Research Scholar will also be encouraged to seek out and develop their own novel data projects, and might also teach a course in the CJS, with the goal of promoting the mix of data and journalism in new ways. This position will be appointed for up to 12 months, may be renewable contingent on performance and the continued availability of funding.   Minimum Degree Required Bachelor’s Degree required   Minimum Qualifications Experience with data and computation, and fluency in a programming language   Preferred Qualifications Advanced degree preferred   Additional Information Other Skills: Has ability to work easily with teams of journalists and other members of the Brown Institute and the CJS community. Should be familiar with current technological innovations in one or more of the following areas: visualization, physical computing, app development, game design, general data and computer science, and computational media. An appreciation for the power of a good story and the ability to experiment with the technical means of its production are key.

Urban Tree Conservation Postdoctoral Research Fellowshipnew;Python;USA;Portland, OR 97214 (Buckman area);The Nature Conservancy;;;"Urban Tree Conservation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship The Nature Conservancy161 reviews - Portland, OR 97214 (Buckman area) Apply On Company Site OFFICE LOCATION  Portland, Oregon, USA OR201  YOUR POSITION WITH TNC  Portland State University & The Nature Conservancy Urban Tree Conservation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship  The Digital City Testbed Center (DCTC) at Portland State University (PSU) is seeking a postdoctoral research fellow (“postdoc”) to work in partnership with the Sustaining Urban Places Research (SUPR) Lab and The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Oregon Chapter to help develop the scientific foundations for improved and equitable urban tree conservation across the Portland metropolitan area and as a national model. DCTC is a PSU initiative focused on “smart city” applications—the use of sensor networks, cloud computing, analytics and artificial intelligence to improve the functioning of city governments and the quality of life for urban residents. Most such programs concentrate on the built environment—buildings, roads, bridges, the electric grid, telecom systems, etc. The current postdoc position is part of an effort to expand the smart-city paradigm to monitor and improve cities’ non-physical, arboreal infrastructure. The goal of the position is to guide the development of resilient and sustainable land management through hyperlocal descriptions of urban trees and supporting management decision making. The postdoc will work in collaboration with PSU faculty in the DCTC and SUPR Lab, TNC staff and other local and national partners, to: (1) Develop protocols using LiDAR, hyperspectral, and other regional datasets for assessing the distribution and characteristics of urban trees; (2) Conduct spatial and statistical analyses to evaluate the effect of urban trees on human and ecological health (likely with additional support from graduate or undergraduate students and external partners); and (3) Lead “spatial action mapping” of urban tree conservation strategies for equitable human health outcomes in the Portland metropolitan region. The postdoc will be expected to communicate results through workshops with partners, peer-reviewed journal articles, conference presentations, and briefings with government and elected officials. Research Objective: The postdoc’s research agenda will have three components: (1) Review literature and relevant datasets to identify techniques for assessing urban tree health, which here refers to how trees are affected by physical stressors such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, soil impoverishment, drought, and insect infestation; (2) Use existing LiDAR and hyperspectral imagery to develop metrics of tree health that are consistent with the literature and with local and regional datasets collected from 2014 through 2019; and (3) Integrate the evaluation of the urban canopy / tree health with additional existing data on the built urban environment, human health, and community values in a spatially explicit formal decision support / structured decision-making framework to guide urban tree conservation strategies (tree planting, preservation, and maintenance) across the Portland metropolitan region. The resulting “spatial action maps” will be collaboratively developed with key community-based organizations, municipal agencies including the Metro Regional Government, the Intertwine Alliance, and other NGOs in order to provide a comprehensive and cohesive regional vision for trees and equitable human health outcomes. The regional scale of the project offers a unique opportunity to assess changes in tree health through time. These analyses will be highly resolved, requiring a good understanding of spatial analysis techniques, land cover change assessments, remote sensing, and inferential statistics that help to explain changes in urban forest health. Similarly, passage of the Portland metro region voter approved 2019 Nature for All bond provides a timely and unique opportunity to inform substantial regional scale investments in urban tree conservation. In funding and managing this position, the DCTC is collaborating with the SUPR Lab and TNC to maintain an interdisciplinary focus on the interactions between sustainable ecosystems and human communities, with faculty and researchers spanning the social, biological, and physical sciences. PSU has over 27,000 students (including nearly 6,000 graduate students) and 124 post-graduate programs hosted in eight schools and colleges. PSU’s campus is located in vibrant downtown Portland, 90 minutes’ drive from the Pacific Coast, the Cascade Mountains, and the Columbia River Gorge. PSU’s location gives faculty, postdocs, and students easy access to a range of community and agency (from the city through the federal level) partners, a diversity of cultural experiences, awardwinning public transportation, a strong biking culture, and a network of urban trails and natural areas. TNC is the world’s largest conservation non-governmental organization, striving to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. The research associate will work as part of the Conservancy’s Oregon science team and will have opportunities to connect and network with Conservancy scientists across the globe. Start date: by July 1st, 2020 Term: The initial appointment is for 1-year (1.00 FTE); funding exists for a 1-year renewal based on performance. Compensation: The starting annual salary rate for this position will be between $52,704 (0 years exp) - $64,008 (7 years exp). The starting salary will be dependent upon the years of experience in a postdoctoral position. PSU’s excellent benefits package includes 95% premium paid healthcare; a generous retirement and vacation package; and reduced tuition rates for employee, spouse or dependent at any of the Oregon Public Universities. Requirements: Candidate for the position must have a PhD in natural resource management, ecological planning, environmental science, geography, ecology, forestry, or other related discipline. Demonstrated scientific writing and communication skills; Recent experience with quantitative data analysis (GIS, R, Python, etc.); and Demonstrated interdisciplinary experience. Preferred Qualifications: Prior experience/ training in climate-human-ecosystem interactions to impact management and decision making from local to global scales; Prior experience/ training in the co-generation of knowledge with stakeholders in need of management solutions; Experience with theory integration and/ or analysis of large data sets; Development of spatially-relevant web-based applications; and Experience facilitating small to medium sized meetings with academic and external partners.
