As a front-end engineer at Retool, you’ll be building a platform that hundreds of customers rely on to run their operations. Every improvement to our product is multiplied across companies that each have hundreds of people who depend on Retool every day. .  We have a small but mighty engineering team. We’ve done a lot with a little, but there’s much more work to be done. In order to continue our rapidly increasing growth, we need to hire world-class, experienced, and motivated engineers to join our team. We have a lot of impact to bring to our customers; you’ll help us get there by owning end-to-end projects, talking with customers, and ultimately supporting the growth of Retool, both the product and the business.

Front-end engineers at Retool collaborate closely with our design team to craft a product that delights our users. You will help extend core differentiating functionality in the application editor, which requires a keen attention to detail and understanding of performance implications. In the future, to keep Retool blazingly fast we may end up experimenting with Core React functionality, Web Workers and WebAssembly.

We’re passionate about empowering our users so their businesses can run more efficiently and effectively. Outside of customer feedback, you’ll also weigh in on our product roadmap which is set collaboratively by design and engineering.  You’ll be working primarily in React and Typescript with a Node.js backend.

Examples of projects you might work on include: expanding and improving content blocking within our extensions, running experiments to measure and improve the usability of the search engine, and taking ownership of product verticals (e.g. local search) on the main Search Results page. We are a remote company, we empower our team to work wherever they want around the world. That means you have to be self-directed and self-motivated to succeed. If that seems awesome and you like the idea of our core values - Build trust, Question assumptions, and Validate direction - you'll fit right in. What you will do: Lead projects from proposal through postmortem, assessing vague problems, proposing high impact solutions, and executing them against a set of success criteria. Contribute to and demonstrate ownership over major features of the SERP and/or Extension, taking responsibility for their maintenance and improvement over time. Step up to resolve product issues – large and small. Play a key role in improving our software architecture (in both our user-facing products, and internal processes) with the goal of increasing quality and throughput. Mentor peers through remote collaboration opportunities in an autonomous environment, including: product brainstorms, technical design discussions, software design best practices and code reviews. Write pragmatic, testable code that works consistently across devices. What we are looking for: Experience working on at least one large frontend application. Deep understanding of software engineering foundations such as data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. Familiarity with MV* concepts and how they apply to JavaScript applications. Effective project management skills. Creative problem solvers and risk takers. You like to take initiative to push projects forward but know when to involve others. Excellent communication skills. You can validate your decisions and communicate them clearly. Other things to know: While we leverage specific job titles for hiring purposes, we do not use them internally. Instead, we follow our own professional levels, with expectations for each level clearly defined across several dimensions. We are a small, remote team distributed across time zones, and we rely on a variety of communication tools throughout the day. You should feel comfortable with the intricacies of this type of work situation. Sometimes we meet up! Expect to travel at least two times a year: once for our all-hands meetup and again for a team retreat (each ~4-5 days). We believe in a focused approach to collaboration, where individual team members work on a single top priority at a time, each supporting larger, company-wide objectives. This philosophy serves to impact our vision to raise the standard of trust online. Our work philosophy centers on empowered project management. All team members have opportunities to run projects. Transparency supports individual and team success at DuckDuckGo. We encourage everyone to participate in areas of interest throughout the company. Anyone and everyone can (and should) ask questions and offer feedback about our products and internal projects. We strive to exemplify our values (build trust, question assumptions, and validate direction) in everything we do. While this is a full-time job, we offer a flexible work arrangement with no core hours, expecting an average commitment of 40 hours per week. We support professional development of our team members through career advisory and a learning stipend, reinforcing our culture of growth and skill-building. DuckDuckGo does not work with any recruiting agencies or services. Instead, we work with each candidate one-on-one throughout a unique hiring process that we've built to reflect our company culture.

Senior Front End Engineernew;Javascript;USA;San Francisco, CA;Sisu;;;At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.  Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, past behaviors, and other organizations like them. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.  As a Sr. Front End Engineer, you’ll be a subject matter expert shaping the future of Sisu’s product interface - a web application that our customers will rely on to “get the facts” to make data driven decisions. You’ll have the opportunity to work on technical challenges including developing our information architecture and solving unique problems, including how to represent statistical data in a digestible way to end users of various knowledge levels. What you'll do: Scale our Typescript / React / Redux front-end Provide technical leadership to drive consensus based on empirical evidence Navigate ambiguity with an open and curious cross-functional team Understand our end user (data analyst) to eventually build a general use product Craft a unique user experience that brings value to global brands. See Samsung and Upwork. Actively partner with product and design to architect user empowering interfaces with performance and scalability in mind Cultivate your design skills and transform Figma mocks into working prototypes Shape the engineering culture through mentorship as our small, dynamic team grows Actively participate in customer POCs to optimize customer experience and adoption. About you: Experience building user-facing products Expertise with React and Redux Expertise with Javascript or Typescript Fluency in HTML, CSS, and ES6 Capable of coaching team members, by translating complex nuances related to the languages and libraries we use, in easy to understand terms. Proficient in utilizing and designing REST and/or GraphQL APIs Excellent communication skills for collaborating internally with partner teams and externally with our customers and end users 5+ years of relevant software engineering experience 4 days ago report job

We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy - it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors. We are seeking an ambitious and nice senior front-end engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company.

The Interview Process The goal of our interview process is to identify people who will be a good fit for our company and are talented, ambitious engineers. Because you will be working remotely, all of our interviews are done over the phone in close succession to move through the process quickly. We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills. We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack. During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company. We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you'd like to meet before accepting an offer.

We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React.

The Interview Process The goal of our interview process is to identify people who will be a good fit for our company and are talented, ambitious engineers. Because you will be working remotely, all of our interviews are done over the phone in close succession to move through the process quickly. We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills. We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack. During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company. We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you'd like to meet before accepting an offer.

Senior Front-end Software Engineer;Javascript;USA;Ann Arbor, MI;Collage.com;;;Collage.com is fortunate to remain open for business during the COVID-19 crisis and to see demand for our product increase. We have been a fully remote workforce for seven years and have been recognized as a leader in remote working. Our employees have continued working with minimal disruption and our hiring efforts are proceeding as planned. By continuing to help our customers bring their special memories to life, we hope to bring smiles to their faces during these stressful times. Collage.com's mission is to make custom products easy for everyone. We strive to do this by providing superior software and excellent customer service. We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 60 employees and $50M annual revenue since 2013. As a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com's co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy - it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors. We are seeking an ambitious and nice senior front-end engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team's growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you. Learn more about working and developing software at Collage.com. Responsibilities Write and maintain front-end JavaScript code as part of a mobile-first web application, including UI components and state management logic. Make decisions about code design, architecture, and refactoring to balance technical debt against delivering functionality. Plan and lead testing for complex projects. Review code and mentor other engineers. Provide time estimates and participate in agile development. Review specifications and work with PMs to implement lean methodology. Required Qualifications 5+ years professional application development experience Experience implementing and testing advanced JavaScript code on a team as part of a production web or mobile application Practical experience with MV* architecture (such as Backbone, Vue, React + Redux/Mobx, etc.), unidirectional data flow, and minimal class/object interfaces Spatial/geometric reasoning ability - for rendering, animation, and image manipulation Ability to quickly understand and work with unfamiliar complex code Pro-active and clear communication is essential for this remote work position Benefits and Perks Working from home makes it easier to focus on results and develop professionally while spending less time commuting.

Collage.com pays 100% of the premium for full health, vision and dental insurance coverage for you and your family in a high-quality Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plan. Flexible work schedule and unlimited vacation policy (work hard and take time when you need it). We'll pay for any computer and home office equipment (within reason) that will help you work better. The Interview Process The goal of our interview process is to identify people who will be a good fit for our company and are talented, ambitious engineers. Because you will be working remotely, all of our interviews are done over the phone in close succession to move through the process quickly. We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills. We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack. During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company. We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you'd like to meet before accepting an offer. You are making an important decision, and we want to make sure you are fully committed to joining our team. 30+ days ago report job

Senior Software Development Engineernew;Javascript;USA;Seattle, WA 98104;ABC Legal Services Inc.;;$130,000 a year;"Senior Software Development Engineer Are you tired of being stuck in endless meetings, being subjected to frequent company reorgs, and having to talk to multiple managers to get anything accomplished? Are you more interested in being part of a small productive development team of an established and profitable company rather than being an employee number at a mega corporation? Check this out! ABC Legal is a locally owned company of 350 employees and thousands of independent contractors, headquartered in Seattle with a nationwide footprint. We file and serve legal documents for law firms-and are the technology leaders in our industry. Our technology group builds software and infrastructure solutions to support our nationwide operations. Law firms use our website to monitor status on cases; independent contractors use our mobile apps all day every day to record geo-tagged events, take photos, and e-sign declarations; our employees use our desktop application to provide customer support and keep legal documents (electronic and printed) flowing. Our culture is casual, open, and direct. We support independent thinking-freeing you to do your best work. WHAT WE OFFER: Our technology group offers a unique, fun, and challenging opportunity for the right person. Here’s what is great about our technology team: We have an awesome team size. Our group is small enough that every one of us has direct and meaningful impact on our business, but big enough that no one has to go it alone or work long hours. You will wear enough different hats to be challenged...but you don’t have to wear them all. We have an awesome company size. You get the family atmosphere of a start-up without the funding worries. The company has a flat hierarchy with very little middle management and a minimal amount of red tape. Our product management is effective. We have strong and accountable product ownership. Many domain experts work in the same building and it is common practice to just walk up and talk to them in person to get clarification on requirements. Our work / life balance is real. We take long vacations, work normal hours, and lead varied lives. We trust each other. From the CEO down, we have strong support for trying new ideas and changing processes to make them better. Teams communicate well and trust each other. We have a cool office in a cool place. We work in a renovated historic Japanese theater with a rooftop deck with a water view. For lunch, we walk to crazy-good cuisine of all styles in the International District. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: We are looking for an application engineer who enjoys implementing new features and is not afraid to learn many parts of our system along the way (including database, server side and client side). We are a team of senior engineers. We discuss design decisions within the group and are always open to consult each other on implementation details.

We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills. We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack. During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company.

At Bloomberg, we take pride in owning the end-to-end development of our software stack. What makes this job great is not only the opportunity to work on tough problems with smart engineers, but also the exposure you'll get to Product Managers, clients, salespeople, and other Engineering teams. This unique combination will give you a comprehensive view of key concepts and inner workings of the financial industry. You need to have: 3+ years of experience with full-stack software development in any major programming language (JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Java, C#, etc) Working knowledge of asynchronous programming techniques Solid understanding of modern application architecture and design patterns  We'd love to see: Experience with Node.js or other server-side JavaScript implementations Experience programming in Python or other interpreted languages Working knowledge of UNIX/Linux operating systems Familiarity with continuous integration and continuous deployment and test automation frameworks  Bloomberg is an equal opportunities employer, and we value diversity at our company.

Senior Software Development Engineernew;Javascript;USA;Seattle, WA 98104;ABC Legal Services Inc.;;$130,000 a year;"Senior Software Development Engineer Are you tired of being stuck in endless meetings, being subjected to frequent company reorgs, and having to talk to multiple managers to get anything accomplished? Are you more interested in being part of a small productive development team of an established and profitable company rather than being an employee number at a mega corporation? Check this out! ABC Legal is a locally owned company of 350 employees and thousands of independent contractors, headquartered in Seattle with a nationwide footprint. We file and serve legal documents for law firms-and are the technology leaders in our industry. Our technology group builds software and infrastructure solutions to support our nationwide operations. Law firms use our website to monitor status on cases; independent contractors use our mobile apps all day every day to record geo-tagged events, take photos, and e-sign declarations; our employees use our desktop application to provide customer support and keep legal documents (electronic and printed) flowing. Our culture is casual, open, and direct. We support independent thinking-freeing you to do your best work. WHAT WE OFFER: Our technology group offers a unique, fun, and challenging opportunity for the right person. Here’s what is great about our technology team: We have an awesome team size. Our group is small enough that every one of us has direct and meaningful impact on our business, but big enough that no one has to go it alone or work long hours. You will wear enough different hats to be challenged...but you don’t have to wear them all. We have an awesome company size. You get the family atmosphere of a start-up without the funding worries. The company has a flat hierarchy with very little middle management and a minimal amount of red tape. Our product management is effective. We have strong and accountable product ownership. Many domain experts work in the same building and it is common practice to just walk up and talk to them in person to get clarification on requirements. Our work / life balance is real. We take long vacations, work normal hours, and lead varied lives. We trust each other. From the CEO down, we have strong support for trying new ideas and changing processes to make them better. Teams communicate well and trust each other. We have a cool office in a cool place. We work in a renovated historic Japanese theater with a rooftop deck with a water view. For lunch, we walk to crazy-good cuisine of all styles in the International District. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: We are looking for an application engineer who enjoys implementing new features and is not afraid to learn many parts of our system along the way (including database, server side and client side). We are a team of senior engineers. We discuss design decisions within the group and are always open to consult each other on implementation details. Our general operating mode however is that once someone signs up for a task they own it and champions it through to completion. The ideal candidate would be a senior engineer that is used to diving into a task and finding a solution, or a junior engineer with a self-starter mentality who is not afraid to get accustomed to many parts of our system and work towards finishing projects more and more independently over time. We all respect each other and don’t hold grudges when the group makes a decision that doesn’t fully align with one’s preference on the particular matter. If you generally have strong opinions on design decisions and have a history of not being able to move on after your team decides against you, then this is probably not a good fit for you. If our team’s mentality suits you and your skills overlap with the skills listed below, then we want to hear from you. We are looking for developers with 5+ years of development experience. Exceptional entry level candidates may be considered. Required Technical Skills: BS/BA in Computer Science or related field experience.

Software Engineer, Front-End - Borrower Core;Javascript;USA;San Francisco, CA 94103 (South of Market area);Blend Labs;;;Blend makes the process of getting a loan simpler, faster, and safer. With its digital lending platform, Blend helps financial institutions including Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank increase productivity and deliver exceptional customer experiences. The company processes nearly $2 billion in loans daily, helping millions of consumers gain access to the capital they need to lead better lives.  The Borrower Core team builds the experience that all borrowers using the Blend platform go through. We are looking for an engineer to help make sure that users have a seamless, trust-inducing experience regardless of their accessibility needs, demographic, or device (the application is fully responsive, and we see around 35% mobile usage). You’ll own the borrower-facing experience top-to-bottom, and while the work is weighted toward the frontend, many features include backend components as well.  We write frontend features with React in ES6/Typescript. We find that type checking helps us catch errors earlier, test better, and ultimately ship quicker and with higher quality. Because our app is white-labeled (think dynamic styling), we use Aphrodite (CSS-in-JS) for all of our styling. Our team also builds and owns its own deployment infrastructure and application serving pipeline. That way we can ship whenever we need to and have full control over making the delivery pipeline as quick and seamless as possible.  On the backend, we write Node.js/Express in ES6/Typescript, and sometimes Go. How you’ll contribute: You’ll help to lead architectural decisions to support immediate and future product and platform needs. You’ll mentor and grow other team members through regular 1:1s, code reviews, and design reviews. You’ll collaborate with product managers, designers, and other engineers to build new features or revamp existing features. You’ll bring your experience to bear to help to improve the processes and patterns of the team. Who you are: You have 4+ years of experience building high-quality production software You have deep experience with one or more modern JavaScript frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. We use React, but we know you’ll pick it up quickly if you haven’t used it in the past. You understand accessibility (a11y) best practices. You’ve worked in a modern product development organization and can effectively collaborate with product and design to guide complex projects to successful outcomes. Bonus Points! Experience with TypeScript. Experience building enterprise software. Experience building a UI platform. Benefits and Perks: Meaningful equity and a 401(k) plan Comprehensive health benefits Sponsored gym memberships, ClassPass credits, or wellness stipend. Lunch, dinner, snacks, and Pizza Fridays On-site meditation, yoga, and massages Flexible work schedule, with open vacation policy 4 months of paid parental or personal leave Convenient location, with parking programs, and flexible commuter options Blend is an equal opportunity employer that values diversity, inclusion and belonging.

Workflows will be open-source, adaptable, and designed with future collaborative research projects in mind. The data portals will provide shared access to project data (data warehousing) and dynamic visualization tools that may be used to explore relationships across data sets: for example, displaying a patient’s treatment history alongside the tumor’s clonal evolution. The portals are being built and deployed on the Google Cloud Platform and in some cases may provide analysis services tailored to the portal’s research focus. Analysis services will be supported through pipelines running on Terra. In the course of developing data portals for these and other projects, we will construct a common platform that can be re-used to develop portals for future projects.

Due to the small size of the development team (2-3 software engineers) and close proximity of users, we employ “lightweight” processes for managing our development projects. While borrowing from agile practices, project management overhead is kept at a minimum. The pace of development is rapid, and software developers have the satisfaction of seeing their software used by lab peers and outside collaborators. Qualifications A Bachelors or Masters degree in Computer Science, Bioinformatics or a related field is required Fluency in Python or Java is required; strong programming skills in R, Javascript and Unix Shell are desireable Experience in web development, relational database systems, and cloud infrastructure is a plus Experience working with genomic data or in the field of bioinformatics is a plus Excellent communication skills and the ability to perform effectively in a fast paced environment Must be able to handle a variety of tasks; effectively solve problems with numerous and complex variables; and be able to shift priorities rapidly Excellent oral and written communication skills (The position will work closely with small project teams of 2-4 researchers. Interfacing with project collaborators in-person and on-line is a key aspect of this position.) Lab Overview The Getz Lab has established itself as a world leader in the development and application of computational tools for the analysis cancer genomes. The lab specializes in cancer genome analyses which include: (i) Characterizing the cancer Genome, (ii) Identifying cancer-associated genes and pathways, and (iii) Characterizing the heterogeneity and clonal evolution of cancer . Characterizing the cancer genome Cancer is a disease of the genome that is driven by a combination of possible germline risk-alleles together with a set of “driver” somatic mutations that are acquired during the clonal expansion of increasingly fitter clones. In order to generate a comprehensive list of all germline and somatic events that occurred during life and the development of the cancer, the lab develops and applies highly sensitive and specific tools for detecting different types of mutations in massively-parallel sequencing data. The volume, noise and complexity of these data require developing computational tools using state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning approaches to extract the signal from the noise. Identifying cancer-associated genes and pathways Next, the detected oncogenic events across a cohort of samples are analyzed, searching for genes/ pathways, as well as non-coding variants, that show significant signals of positive selection. To that end, we construct a statistical model of the background mutational processes and then detect genes that deviate from it. As part of constructing the models, we study and infer the mutational processes that affected the samples (carcinogens, defects in repair mechanisms, etc.) and their timing. We have developed tools for detecting significantly gained or lost genes in cancer and genes with increased density or irregular patterns of mutations. Our work demonstrated the importance of modeling the heterogeneity of these models across patients, sequence contexts and the genome, when searching for cancer genes. Heterogeneity and clonal evolution of cancer Cancer samples are heterogeneous, containing a mixture of normal cells and cancer cells that often represent multiple subclones. We developed and continue to develop tools for characterizing the heterogeneity of cancer samples using copy-number and mutation data measured on bulk samples and now also analyzing the genomic material in individual cells. Using these tools, we can infer which mutations are clonal or sub-clonal, as well as estimate the number of subclones and their distribution over space and time.

We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills. We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack. During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company. We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you'd like to meet before accepting an offer. You are making an important decision, and we want to make sure you are fully committed to joining our team. 30+ days ago report job

We all help out in other areas as needed, so the ability to flex is extremely important. But, did I mention that we have fun too? Because we do!  Unlike many companies, advanced education is not a requirement at Farmgirl. We believe that the best individuals come with varied backgrounds and experiences, and value work ethic, problem-solving skills, intellectual curiosity, and a positive attitude more than a specific degree. Farmgirl Flowers is an equal opportunity employer and we greatly value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.  Farmgirl Flowers is building a remote first engineering team to scale our ability to serve more customers as we experience a period of rapid growth.

For us, this means doing the right thing even when it is the difficult thing. We live these ideals by providing jobs that pay above the minimum wage with good benefits and 401Ks. We also do this by occasionally taking a stand on what some may consider controversial issues that we feel are important to us both as a business and as people. When we take these stands, we do so under the Farmgirl Flowers brand. As an employee, we understand these views may be associated with you simply by your employment with us. Please understand that when we make public any beliefs we do not expect nor mandate our employees (or potential employees) to ascribe to these beliefs as well. For the sake of transparency, we believe it is important you understand what Farmgirl Flowers stands for as you consider joining our team.

Senior Software Development Engineernew;Javascript;USA;Seattle, WA 98104;ABC Legal Services Inc.;;$130,000 a year;"Senior Software Development Engineer Are you tired of being stuck in endless meetings, being subjected to frequent company reorgs, and having to talk to multiple managers to get anything accomplished? Are you more interested in being part of a small productive development team of an established and profitable company rather than being an employee number at a mega corporation? Check this out! ABC Legal is a locally owned company of 350 employees and thousands of independent contractors, headquartered in Seattle with a nationwide footprint. We file and serve legal documents for law firms-and are the technology leaders in our industry. Our technology group builds software and infrastructure solutions to support our nationwide operations. Law firms use our website to monitor status on cases; independent contractors use our mobile apps all day every day to record geo-tagged events, take photos, and e-sign declarations; our employees use our desktop application to provide customer support and keep legal documents (electronic and printed) flowing. Our culture is casual, open, and direct. We support independent thinking-freeing you to do your best work. WHAT WE OFFER: Our technology group offers a unique, fun, and challenging opportunity for the right person. Here’s what is great about our technology team: We have an awesome team size. Our group is small enough that every one of us has direct and meaningful impact on our business, but big enough that no one has to go it alone or work long hours. You will wear enough different hats to be challenged...but you don’t have to wear them all. We have an awesome company size. You get the family atmosphere of a start-up without the funding worries. The company has a flat hierarchy with very little middle management and a minimal amount of red tape. Our product management is effective. We have strong and accountable product ownership. Many domain experts work in the same building and it is common practice to just walk up and talk to them in person to get clarification on requirements. Our work / life balance is real. We take long vacations, work normal hours, and lead varied lives. We trust each other. From the CEO down, we have strong support for trying new ideas and changing processes to make them better. Teams communicate well and trust each other. We have a cool office in a cool place. We work in a renovated historic Japanese theater with a rooftop deck with a water view. For lunch, we walk to crazy-good cuisine of all styles in the International District. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: We are looking for an application engineer who enjoys implementing new features and is not afraid to learn many parts of our system along the way (including database, server side and client side). We are a team of senior engineers. We discuss design decisions within the group and are always open to consult each other on implementation details. Our general operating mode however is that once someone signs up for a task they own it and champions it through to completion. The ideal candidate would be a senior engineer that is used to diving into a task and finding a solution, or a junior engineer with a self-starter mentality who is not afraid to get accustomed to many parts of our system and work towards finishing projects more and more independently over time. We all respect each other and don’t hold grudges when the group makes a decision that doesn’t fully align with one’s preference on the particular matter. If you generally have strong opinions on design decisions and have a history of not being able to move on after your team decides against you, then this is probably not a good fit for you. If our team’s mentality suits you and your skills overlap with the skills listed below, then we want to hear from you. We are looking for developers with 5+ years of development experience. Exceptional entry level candidates may be considered. Required Technical Skills: BS/BA in Computer Science or related field experience.

Software Development Engineernew;Javascript;USA;Tucson, AZ;ABC Legal Services Inc.;;;"Software Development Engineer Are you tired of being stuck in endless meetings, being subjected to frequent company reorgs, and having to talk to multiple managers to get anything accomplished? Are you more interested in being part of a small productive development team of an established and profitable company rather than being an employee number at a mega corporation? Check this out! ABC Legal is a locally owned company of 350 employees and thousands of independent contractors, headquartered in Seattle with a nationwide footprint. We file and serve legal documents for law firms-and are the technology leaders in our industry. Our technology group builds software and infrastructure solutions to support our nationwide operations. Law firms use our website to monitor status on cases; independent contractors use our mobile apps all day every day to record geo-tagged events, take photos, and e-sign declarations; our employees use our desktop application to provide customer support and keep legal documents (electronic and printed) flowing. Our culture is casual, open, and direct. We support independent thinking-freeing you to do your best work. WHAT WE OFFER: Our technology group offers a unique, fun, and challenging opportunity for the right person. Here’s what is great about our technology team: We have an awesome team size. Our group is small enough that every one of us has direct and meaningful impact on our business, but big enough that no one has to go it alone or work long hours. You will wear enough different hats to be challenged...but you don’t have to wear them all. We have an awesome company size. You get the family atmosphere of a start-up without the funding worries. The company has a flat hierarchy with very little middle management and a minimal amount of red tape. Our product management is effective. We have strong and accountable product ownership. Many domain experts work in the same building and it is common practice to just walk up and talk to them in person to get clarification on requirements. Our work / life balance is real. We take long vacations, work normal hours, and lead varied lives. We trust each other. From the CEO down, we have strong support for trying new ideas and changing processes to make them better. Teams communicate well and trust each other. We have a cool office in a cool place. We work in a renovated historic Japanese theater with a rooftop deck with a water view. For lunch, we walk to crazy-good cuisine of all styles in the International District. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: We are looking for Software engineers who enjoy implementing new features and are not afraid to learn many parts of our system along the way (including database, server side and client side). We are a team of senior engineers. We discuss design decisions within the group and are always open to consult each other on implementation details. Our general operating mode however is that once someone signs up for a task they own it and champions it through to completion. The ideal candidate would be a senior engineer that is used to diving into a task and finding a solution, or a junior engineer with a self-starter mentality who is not afraid to get accustomed to many parts of our system and work towards finishing projects more and more independently over time. We all respect each other and don’t hold grudges when the group makes a decision that doesn’t fully align with one’s preference on the particular matter. If you generally have strong opinions on design decisions and have a history of not being able to move on after your team decides against you, then this is probably not a good fit for you. If our team’s mentality suits you and your skills overlap with the skills listed below, then we want to hear from you. Required Technical Skills: BS/BA in Computer Science or related field experience. Java (C#, C++ or similar object oriented languages are acceptable too) Web UI framework like Angular\ React\Vue etc. Desired Technical Skills: Web technologies including JQuery, XHTML, JavaScript, Ajax, XML, HTML, CSS AWS and any popular cloud platform.

The first area is to develop a back-end infrastructure that leverages cloud computing to run ADAPT across thousands of viruses. The second area is to develop a front-end interface to make available these diagnostic designs and to visualize the outputs of a system for monitoring the effectiveness of molecular diagnostic assays against emerging genomic diversity. This may involve learning and implementing distributed computing systems, creating APIs, and developing web user interfaces for visualization (e.g., Vue or React). The candidate will have an opportunity to contribute to new, impactful computational methods and publications. We welcome candidates with different levels of experience. Familiarly with biology is helpful but not required. Most importantly, a successful candidate will be talented at developing software and enthusiastic about contributing to viral diagnostics, both for COVID-19 and other viruses.

Associate Software Engineer - Getz Labnew;Javascript;USA;Cambridge, MA 02142 (MIT area);Broad Institute;;;"The Getz Lab in the Broad Institute’s Cancer Program has an open position for an associate software engineer. The holder of this position will be responsible for the development of computational pipelines for the analysis of genomic, functional genomic and proteomic data. In addition, the engineer will assist in the development of data portals supporting the lab’s participation in a number of large collaborative research projects, including an IBM partnership studying drug resistance in cancer treatments and NCI’s Center for Cancer Genomics’ Genomic Data Analysis Network (GDAN). Pipeline development and testing will be conducted on a multiple computational environments, including Jupyter notebooks, Unix VMs, HPC clusters on the Cloud, and Terra, Broad’s scalable, cloud-based platform for conducting large-scale computational analysis on genomic data. In the course of developing these workflows, you will contribute to the evolution of our lab’s processes and standards for conducting genomic research. Workflows will be open-source, adaptable, and designed with future collaborative research projects in mind. The data portals will provide shared access to project data (data warehousing) and dynamic visualization tools that may be used to explore relationships across data sets: for example, displaying a patient’s treatment history alongside the tumor’s clonal evolution. The portals are being built and deployed on the Google Cloud Platform and in some cases may provide analysis services tailored to the portal’s research focus. Analysis services will be supported through pipelines running on Terra. In the course of developing data portals for these and other projects, we will construct a common platform that can be re-used to develop portals for future projects. The platform will be open-source, adaptable, and designed with future collaborative research projects in mind. Responsibilities Work in a collaborative setting with teams of developers and computational biologists to develop and benchmark workflows Integrate new genomic analysis algorithms and/or data types Extend and/or refactor existing workflows and software infrastructure Assist in the creation of new software and data infrastructure Participate in analysis working groups operating in large collaborative projects the Getz Lab participates in: Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), Genomic Data Analysis Network (GDAN), Stand Up to Cancer Dream Teams, and the Broad/IBM project to study drug resistance in cancer treatment. Portal deployment, operational support, and maintenance (note that we deploy portals and web apps on Google App Engine and thus leverage Google Cloud Services for most operational tasks) Some medical, genomics, or scientific background is preferred, but we primarily are looking for an enthusiasm to contribute to advances in the scientific understanding and treatment of cancer, and an ability to write exceptional software in an environment that is highly responsive to it’s users’ needs. Due to the small size of the development team (2-3 software engineers) and close proximity of users, we employ “lightweight” processes for managing our development projects. While borrowing from agile practices, project management overhead is kept at a minimum. The pace of development is rapid, and software developers have the satisfaction of seeing their software used by lab peers and outside collaborators. Qualifications A Bachelors or Masters degree in Computer Science, Bioinformatics or a related field is required Fluency in Python or Java is required; strong programming skills in R, Javascript and Unix Shell are desireable Experience in web development, relational database systems, and cloud infrastructure is a plus Experience working with genomic data or in the field of bioinformatics is a plus Excellent communication skills and the ability to perform effectively in a fast paced environment Must be able to handle a variety of tasks; effectively solve problems with numerous and complex variables; and be able to shift priorities rapidly Excellent oral and written communication skills (The position will work closely with small project teams of 2-4 researchers. Interfacing with project collaborators in-person and on-line is a key aspect of this position.) Lab Overview The Getz Lab has established itself as a world leader in the development and application of computational tools for the analysis cancer genomes. The lab specializes in cancer genome analyses which include: (i) Characterizing the cancer Genome, (ii) Identifying cancer-associated genes and pathways, and (iii) Characterizing the heterogeneity and clonal evolution of cancer . Characterizing the cancer genome Cancer is a disease of the genome that is driven by a combination of possible germline risk-alleles together with a set of “driver” somatic mutations that are acquired during the clonal expansion of increasingly fitter clones. In order to generate a comprehensive list of all germline and somatic events that occurred during life and the development of the cancer, the lab develops and applies highly sensitive and specific tools for detecting different types of mutations in massively-parallel sequencing data. The volume, noise and complexity of these data require developing computational tools using state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning approaches to extract the signal from the noise. Identifying cancer-associated genes and pathways Next, the detected oncogenic events across a cohort of samples are analyzed, searching for genes/ pathways, as well as non-coding variants, that show significant signals of positive selection. To that end, we construct a statistical model of the background mutational processes and then detect genes that deviate from it. As part of constructing the models, we study and infer the mutational processes that affected the samples (carcinogens, defects in repair mechanisms, etc.) and their timing. We have developed tools for detecting significantly gained or lost genes in cancer and genes with increased density or irregular patterns of mutations. Our work demonstrated the importance of modeling the heterogeneity of these models across patients, sequence contexts and the genome, when searching for cancer genes. Heterogeneity and clonal evolution of cancer Cancer samples are heterogeneous, containing a mixture of normal cells and cancer cells that often represent multiple subclones. We developed and continue to develop tools for characterizing the heterogeneity of cancer samples using copy-number and mutation data measured on bulk samples and now also analyzing the genomic material in individual cells. Using these tools, we can infer which mutations are clonal or sub-clonal, as well as estimate the number of subclones and their distribution over space and time. Correlating these analyses with clinical data, we can gain insite into the development of resistance during the course of treatment. We are now working to introduce these concepts to clinical trials and eventually clinical care. Collaborative Science Members of the Getz Lab work closely with clinical researchers and in large collaborative projects sponsored by NIH (e.g., TCGA) and charitable initiatives (e.g, Stand Up to Cancer, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative) and industry partners. These collaborative efforts are significantly enhanced by the creation of data portals for the sharing of experimental data, analysis results and tools. #LI-DNP All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or protected veteran status. 5 days ago report job"

With its digital lending platform, Blend helps financial institutions including Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank increase productivity and deliver exceptional customer experiences. The company processes nearly $2 billion in loans daily, helping millions of consumers gain access to the capital they need to lead better lives.  The Borrower Core team builds the experience that all borrowers using the Blend platform go through. We are looking for an engineer to help make sure that users have a seamless, trust-inducing experience regardless of their accessibility needs, demographic, or device (the application is fully responsive, and we see around 35% mobile usage). You’ll own the borrower-facing experience top-to-bottom, and while the work is weighted toward the frontend, many features include backend components as well.  We write frontend features with React in ES6/Typescript. We find that type checking helps us catch errors earlier, test better, and ultimately ship quicker and with higher quality. Because our app is white-labeled (think dynamic styling), we use Aphrodite (CSS-in-JS) for all of our styling. Our team also builds and owns its own deployment infrastructure and application serving pipeline. That way we can ship whenever we need to and have full control over making the delivery pipeline as quick and seamless as possible.  On the backend, we write Node.js/Express in ES6/Typescript, and sometimes Go. How you’ll contribute: You’ll help to lead architectural decisions to support immediate and future product and platform needs. You’ll mentor and grow other team members through regular 1:1s, code reviews, and design reviews. You’ll collaborate with product managers, designers, and other engineers to build new features or revamp existing features. You’ll bring your experience to bear to help to improve the processes and patterns of the team. Who you are: You have 4+ years of experience building high-quality production software You have deep experience with one or more modern JavaScript frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. We use React, but we know you’ll pick it up quickly if you haven’t used it in the past. You understand accessibility (a11y) best practices. You’ve worked in a modern product development organization and can effectively collaborate with product and design to guide complex projects to successful outcomes. Bonus Points! Experience with TypeScript. Experience building enterprise software. Experience building a UI platform. Benefits and Perks: Meaningful equity and a 401(k) plan Comprehensive health benefits Sponsored gym memberships, ClassPass credits, or wellness stipend. Lunch, dinner, snacks, and Pizza Fridays On-site meditation, yoga, and massages Flexible work schedule, with open vacation policy 4 months of paid parental or personal leave Convenient location, with parking programs, and flexible commuter options Blend is an equal opportunity employer that values diversity, inclusion and belonging. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status disability status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

Lead Front-End Engineer;Javascript;USA;New York, NY 10003 (Greenwich Village area);Free Agency;;Up to $165,000 a year;Free Agency is a unique talent startup that helps people upgrade and accelerate their career trajectory. Hollywood entertainers and athletes have agents - why shouldn't everyone else? We currently serve clients (Free Agents) who work in the technology industry. We've raised $5.35m from amazing investors, including Resolute Ventures, Bloomberg Beta, Ludlow Ventures, and more. We represent knowledge workers in their careers, similar to agents or brokers in other industries. Some of what we provide is digital, such as tools to track skills, interesting jobs, and career progress. Most of what we provide is concierge service, in the form of Talent Agents who pair with our Free Agent clients on a one-to-one basis. However, we are now in the process of creating a suite of digital products to stack on top of our human-powered services. These are all consumer-facing web and mobile applications focused on job search, career management, and professional development. While we can't get into all the details, these products are going to be first-of-their-kind tools that empower our current clients (and others!) to better land dream jobs, track their career progress, reach long-term goals, and interact with experts and Free Agency. We use proprietary data science, our community of Free Agents and alumni, and our opinion of how the recruiting world should work to fuel innovative tools that inform and empower our users. We're looking to make our first engineering hire in the form of a Senior or Lead Front-End Engineer. This individual will be responsible for the design and implementation of the entirety of our products' front ends. You will be reporting to and directly working with the COO, who is a VP of Engineering by background, and collaborating very closely with the CEO, who has extensive product experience. Depending on your seniority, as the technical team grows, you will be central to defining the culture, determining future roles, and hiring or mentoring future team members. Your responsibilities will include: Collaborating with the CEO and COO on building modern, customer-facing products and UI Writing high-quality code with a focus on user experience and performance Responding to rapid feedback cycles and additional feature requests + A/B tests Working across a portfolio of products, switching priorities throughout each quarter Mentoring (and potentially managing) future junior engineers Qualifications: 3+ years experience at a technology company Comfortable coding in JavaScript (or TypeScript) Experience with modern JavaScript libraries and tooling (e.g. React) Fluency in HTML, CSS, and related web technologies Awareness of cross-browser compatibility issues Appreciation for clean design and intuitive UX Motivated and able to work independently, with an eye for details Experience developing an idea into a polished product Experience leading or mentoring junior engineers Things that you may want to know: We are a ship-fast culture, but we don't settle for sloppy MVPs. If you don't inherently care about pushing pixels around, we might drive you crazy. The CEO will be the primary product manager and design leader for the foreseeable future, and thus you should feel comfortable having infrequent check-ins with your stakeholder. We don't mind whether you're on the lesser or more experienced end of the spectrum. This role is adaptable based on seniority. Internally, you will: Report directly to the COO, who is a VP of Engineering by background. Work closely with the CEO, who is a product leader by background. Collaborate with other engineers on product development. Compensation: This depends on your experience and how much of the role we expect you to fulfill immediately. If we're taking more of a bet on you, you should expect to make around $130,000. If you're more senior and immensely qualified, you could make up to $165,000. We also offer equity in the business and we'll be extremely transparent during offer-stage as to the details of any equity offering. 30+ days ago report job

Senior Software Development Engineernew;Javascript;USA;Seattle, WA 98104;ABC Legal Services Inc.;;$130,000 a year;"Senior Software Development Engineer Are you tired of being stuck in endless meetings, being subjected to frequent company reorgs, and having to talk to multiple managers to get anything accomplished? Are you more interested in being part of a small productive development team of an established and profitable company rather than being an employee number at a mega corporation? Check this out! ABC Legal is a locally owned company of 350 employees and thousands of independent contractors, headquartered in Seattle with a nationwide footprint. We file and serve legal documents for law firms-and are the technology leaders in our industry. Our technology group builds software and infrastructure solutions to support our nationwide operations. Law firms use our website to monitor status on cases; independent contractors use our mobile apps all day every day to record geo-tagged events, take photos, and e-sign declarations; our employees use our desktop application to provide customer support and keep legal documents (electronic and printed) flowing. Our culture is casual, open, and direct. We support independent thinking-freeing you to do your best work. WHAT WE OFFER: Our technology group offers a unique, fun, and challenging opportunity for the right person. Here’s what is great about our technology team: We have an awesome team size. Our group is small enough that every one of us has direct and meaningful impact on our business, but big enough that no one has to go it alone or work long hours. You will wear enough different hats to be challenged...but you don’t have to wear them all. We have an awesome company size. You get the family atmosphere of a start-up without the funding worries. The company has a flat hierarchy with very little middle management and a minimal amount of red tape. Our product management is effective. We have strong and accountable product ownership. Many domain experts work in the same building and it is common practice to just walk up and talk to them in person to get clarification on requirements. Our work / life balance is real. We take long vacations, work normal hours, and lead varied lives. We trust each other. From the CEO down, we have strong support for trying new ideas and changing processes to make them better. Teams communicate well and trust each other. We have a cool office in a cool place. We work in a renovated historic Japanese theater with a rooftop deck with a water view. For lunch, we walk to crazy-good cuisine of all styles in the International District. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: We are looking for an application engineer who enjoys implementing new features and is not afraid to learn many parts of our system along the way (including database, server side and client side). We are a team of senior engineers. We discuss design decisions within the group and are always open to consult each other on implementation details. Our general operating mode however is that once someone signs up for a task they own it and champions it through to completion. The ideal candidate would be a senior engineer that is used to diving into a task and finding a solution, or a junior engineer with a self-starter mentality who is not afraid to get accustomed to many parts of our system and work towards finishing projects more and more independently over time. We all respect each other and don’t hold grudges when the group makes a decision that doesn’t fully align with one’s preference on the particular matter. If you generally have strong opinions on design decisions and have a history of not being able to move on after your team decides against you, then this is probably not a good fit for you. If our team’s mentality suits you and your skills overlap with the skills listed below, then we want to hear from you. We are looking for developers with 5+ years of development experience. Exceptional entry level candidates may be considered. Required Technical Skills: BS/BA in Computer Science or related field experience. Java (C#, C++ or similar object oriented languages are acceptable too) Desired Technical Skills: Web technologies including JQuery, XHTML, JavaScript, Ajax, XML, HTML, CSS Web UI framework like Angular\React\Vue etc. Experience in Java applications using the Spring Framework, Spring Web MVC Strong experience in developing and consuming SOAP/REST based web services Experience with AWS or any other popular cloud platform Experience with the Metro web service stack.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.  The Role  We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems.  The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration.  You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level. Technologies We Use Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. TypeScript and React are central to our front-end development. Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library. A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand. Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and GitHub. What We Value You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work. You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems. Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building. Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
