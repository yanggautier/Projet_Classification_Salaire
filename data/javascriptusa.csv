We know that providers didn’t go into medicine to see an ever-increasing number of patients at lightning speed, and that they want the freedom and autonomy to deliver care according to their own principles and preferences.

You’ve worked in a modern product development organization and can effectively collaborate with product and design to guide complex projects to successful outcomes. Bonus Points!

Product/UX Designer;Javascript;USA;San Francisco, CA 94110 (Mission area);Notion;;;What if you had the chance to design something iconic? Imagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computers should look and feel for people who had never seen one before. That's what we're trying to do here at Notion — build software that feels timeless, with the craftsmanship of German cameras, playfulness of Japanese wooden toys, and mass appeal of Coca-Cola. We are looking for people with the unique skillset that can pull that off.  Why this Role?  1. Create a toolbox that will redefine computing: Because Notion helps people build their own custom tools, we have the opportunity to create the most leveraged and useful software of the last (or next) decade. You can help us realize this goal. 2. Tackle our most interesting and impactful problems: Our team is small, and people wear many hats. You'd jump between product, marketing, internal tools, process — participating in every phase from inception to implementation. Absolutely no boredom. 3. Join us at a magical time: We've hit profitability and over a million users with a very small team, which gives us a huge green field to work with. You'd join at the perfect time to shape what we build and how we grow. 4. Accelerate your learning as a maker: You'll get to flex a versatile set of muscles, balancing vision, craft, and business potential for a product designed to be practical and solve real problems. No matter what skills you bring, you'll have the chance to level up. 5. Work with some of the best engineers in the world: A team of less than 5 built a product used by over a million people. We've achieved more than teams 10x our size by solving problems from first principles and creating our own tech to magnify our output. So, what will you do at Notion as a product/UX designer? Craft every detail of new product features, from idea to UX to pixel-perfect execution. Partner closely with our Community & Support team to understand what users need, want, and love about Notion. Use this data to plan and scope our product roadmap. Create design systems that are simple to understand but help us to move faster as we scale. (But don't go overboard with it. We're pretty sure premature optimization is one of the deadly sins.) Work with marketing to devise new ways to tell great stories throughout the user lifecycle, and across our site, product, help guides and other channels. If you can: polish each feature in code. (We love to hire designers who can code so there's no back-and-forth handoff with engineering — this helps us move fast! See more details in the Designer Who Can Code @ Notion job post) This might be for you if... You can create pixel-perfect visual designs (UI). You can untangle hard conceptual problems and have sharp intuition for how people use (or wish they could use) products (UX). You care about the business needs, implications, and possibilities of your designs. You don't get stuck on pretty UI, and can balance between craft, speed and the bottom line. You have strong beliefs, loosely held. You're a good listener who likes to collaborate. You like to tell stories using both words and visuals, and strategize the best way to make your point. As a bonus, you're familiar with the work of computing heroes like Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Bret Victor, etc. — and understand why we're big fans. If you can, create production-level coding in HTML + CSS + basic Javascript. (Even better if you're capable of procedure or React-level Javascript.

Javascript Developer;Javascript;USA;Remote;Silverfin;;;"If you’re any good at Javascript, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-recruitment@silverfin.com.  Ahum. Here it comes. What’s a Silverfin? At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.  The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in. What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special? We’re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring in this regard, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.  Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.  Being remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!  We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #dev channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments. What does working at Silverfin look like? We work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people.  You’ll be supported by our UI designer who develops and maintains HTML and CSS components into a reusable UI-framework, and can also build Vue.js prototypes when necessary. You’ll often work together with them to tweak the look and feel before deploying new features and changes. For the more complex features we’ll often write a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) first so the product team can do usability tests with real users. This allows us to validate the assumptions we make during product design.  We use Vue.js, vanilla JS and a bit of jQuery for the interactive parts of our application, and an up-to-date Rails monolith for the backend. Rails also renders the html for the less interactive parts of the application. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice.  No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.  Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you should issues arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.  Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 7TB*, and our largest table recently crossed the 10 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.  : Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?  What does your future look like? Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to get promoted. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.  Everyone has a €1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation and travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. What are we looking for? You have at least 3 years of professional experience in Javascript. You have some experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough. You also have experience using Rails and have used it as an api as well as for rendering HTML. You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls. You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development. You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally. You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as separation of concerns. You're aware of the trade-offs involved in engineering, product design, as well as the bigger “business” picture. You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary. Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h) Nice to have’s These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you. Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team An eye for detail Experience in UI/UX design Experience in Fintech Basic understanding of accounting What can we offer you? Actual, proper work-life balance Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely Personal growth training and opportunities Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues A €1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills Interested?

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.  The Role  Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.  FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.  You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers. Technologies We Use Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms. Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing. Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools. Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies. Python for data processing and analysis. Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3. Our Principles Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves. Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them. Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress. What We Value Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance. Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you’re building. Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. Willingness and interest to travel as needed. Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

The Role  Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.  FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.  You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more.

You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers. Technologies We Use Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms. Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing. Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools. Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies. Python for data processing and analysis. Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3. Our Principles Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves. Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them. Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress. What We Value Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance. Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you’re building. Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. Willingness and interest to travel as needed.
