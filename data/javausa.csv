You have at least 3-5+ years of software engineering experience and are looking for an opportunity to shine, a team where you can thrive, one that recognizes your capabilities and rewards you accordingly. You have experience in software development with Golang and Java. Experience working with Kafka streaming. You have designed and developed distributed systems, API, workflow, concurrency, multithreading, and synchronization. You have foundation in data structures, algorithms and software design with strong analytical and debugging skills. Proficiency in object-oriented programming.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.  The Role  Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.  FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.  You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers. Technologies We Use Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments. Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms. Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing. Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools. Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies. Python for data processing and analysis. Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3. Our Principles Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better. Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems. Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves. Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them. Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress. What We Value Active US Security clearance, or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance. Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics. Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools. Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you’re building. Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users. Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. Willingness and interest to travel as needed. Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

We offer a health benefits platform that engages employees to make better healthcare decisions and can guide them to the right program, care, and provider. The platform also enables benefit leaders to communicate and measure their programs while driving employee engagement with targeted, relevant communications.

Description Castlight Health is seeking a Software Engineering Intern to join our Web Applications team based in San Francisco, CA.  Castlight wants to help users navigate the world of healthcare and sickcare. That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat. And, on the other side of the equation, if you need an wrist X-ray for that carpal tunnel from either too much coding, or more likely too much texting – and then choose the best doctor for you. Whether that choice is based on quality, price, distance or all three – Castlight has you covered. Quick tip – go to an imaging center, not a hospital – our research shows you will save money and they all use the same equipment. Sure, Castlight provides much more like personalized recommendations, understandable summaries of your company’s benefit programs, a history of all your claims, and current HSA/HRA balances – and how much to go before your care is free for the rest of the year.  Our summer interns are an integral part of our team. You will work on real projects on our production system as part of our standard scrum teams. Thus, the specific work will vary by scrum team, but all interns will have the opportunity to write and test software in a web application framework, while partnering with a group of experienced software engineers who help and challenge them as they work on projects that matter to our customers. Collaborating with other developers and designers, the Web Applications team delivers innovative, engaging products that empower users to make the best choices for their health.

(HDMS), a subsidiary of CVS/Aetna, is a Software Development Company on the cutting edge of health IT data solutions. Offering data warehouse, management and analysis tools for the healthcare industry, HDMS strives to improve and enhance its product suite for health plans, employers and providers through constant innovation. HDMS' web-based products and services provide flexible, high-value reporting tools that empower users to maximize the value of their health care data and support benefit decisions.  This position's requirements include a solid understanding of language, frameworks, unit testing frameworks on your platform; collects business requirements from interviews and translates into sound, creative software designs that effectively weigh business and technical tradeoffs.  Join a team building the next generation cloud-based products that our clients will use in mining their healthcare information for insight. 70726 Fundamental Components: Key Skills: Demonstrated ability and desire to quickly comprehend complex and unfamiliar codebases. There are no black boxes if you have the source code (and, sometimes, even if you don’t). Strong debugging and analysis skills, forging ahead when the tracks lead off the familiar path. View error messages as an invitation to start a journey rather than a STOP sign. Strive to divine original developer intent when studying existing code, and to puzzle disparate pieces together into cohesive understanding. Know and love ‘git blame’ or equivalent, and relish finding an offhand comment in an old Jira issue that holds the answer to a small mystery! Recognize when you don’t completely understand something germane to the task at hand, and spend the time to gain that understanding, as a prerequisite for a correct and confident solution. Possess an aversion to ‘shotgunning’ problems. Accept the challenges inevitably associated with large legacy code bases and look for ways to leave the place better than you found it. Small improvements add up. Aim to write code that is so clear and concise it looks trivially simple in hindsight, making you wonder how it took you so long to get to that point. Simple solutions are harder to create than complex ones and are much more valuable. Mark Twain captured it well with his quote: “I apologize for such a long letter - I didn't have time to write a short one.”  Key Technologies: Java 8. Overall Java expertise essential; a love of patterns enabled by Java 8’s lambda expressions is…also essential. Immutability! Streams and functional programming paradigms! Sure, there’s plenty of older code that doesn’t use it, but now we can! Spring Framework, with a focus on the core IoC container, Spring MVC controllers, and (for bonus points) Spring Security. Do you really ‘get’ scopes? Great. Have you written your own? Even better! Are dynamic proxies explicable rather than black magic you take on faith? Fantastic; black magic has a dark side. Vaadin UI development knowledge is a plus. Don’t know Vaadin? Some GWT experience gets you halfway there. DVCS experience. Mercurial knowledge is perfect; Git competence and an open mind are good enough. Knowing enough JavaScript to code your way out of a paper bag is helpful; knowing enough CSS to make the bag pretty and responsive is even better.  Background Experience:  Ability to take responsibility for the implementation, quality, and operation of large features, such as an epic-level story or multi-sprint feature. Ability to estimate size accurately and deliver on-time and to specification regularly based on those estimates. Experience translating large features into software designs. 5 years’ software development experience, full life cycle development. 3 years’ experience developing apps on the specific platform. 5+ years’ of practical work experience with Java or JavaScript on a cloud-based platform. Experience using Docker on a cloud-based platform is a plus, particularly having scaled containers across multiple Docker daemons. Experience using continuous deployment / continuous integration (CI / CD) technology. Able to produce coherent and audience friendly written documentation. Professional communication skills both written and verbal.

Sr. Full Stack Engineer - 70726BR;Java;USA;Chicago, IL (West Loop Gate area);AETNA;;;"Sr. Full Stack Engineer - 70726BR AETNA5,279 reviews - Chicago, IL (West Loop Gate area) Remote Apply On Company Site Description:  Health Data & Management Solutions, Inc. (HDMS), a subsidiary of CVS/Aetna, is a Software Development Company on the cutting edge of health IT data solutions. Offering data warehouse, management and analysis tools for the healthcare industry, HDMS strives to improve and enhance its product suite for health plans, employers and providers through constant innovation. HDMS' web-based products and services provide flexible, high-value reporting tools that empower users to maximize the value of their health care data and support benefit decisions.  This position's requirements include a solid understanding of language, frameworks, unit testing frameworks on your platform; collects business requirements from interviews and translates into sound, creative software designs that effectively weigh business and technical tradeoffs.  Join a team building the next generation cloud-based products that our clients will use in mining their healthcare information for insight. 70726 Fundamental Components: Key Skills: Demonstrated ability and desire to quickly comprehend complex and unfamiliar codebases. There are no black boxes if you have the source code (and, sometimes, even if you don’t). Strong debugging and analysis skills, forging ahead when the tracks lead off the familiar path. View error messages as an invitation to start a journey rather than a STOP sign. Strive to divine original developer intent when studying existing code, and to puzzle disparate pieces together into cohesive understanding. Know and love ‘git blame’ or equivalent, and relish finding an offhand comment in an old Jira issue that holds the answer to a small mystery! Recognize when you don’t completely understand something germane to the task at hand, and spend the time to gain that understanding, as a prerequisite for a correct and confident solution. Possess an aversion to ‘shotgunning’ problems. Accept the challenges inevitably associated with large legacy code bases and look for ways to leave the place better than you found it. Small improvements add up. Aim to write code that is so clear and concise it looks trivially simple in hindsight, making you wonder how it took you so long to get to that point. Simple solutions are harder to create than complex ones and are much more valuable. Mark Twain captured it well with his quote: “I apologize for such a long letter - I didn't have time to write a short one.”  Key Technologies: Java 8. Overall Java expertise essential; a love of patterns enabled by Java 8’s lambda expressions is…also essential. Immutability! Streams and functional programming paradigms! Sure, there’s plenty of older code that doesn’t use it, but now we can! Spring Framework, with a focus on the core IoC container, Spring MVC controllers, and (for bonus points) Spring Security. Do you really ‘get’ scopes? Great. Have you written your own? Even better! Are dynamic proxies explicable rather than black magic you take on faith? Fantastic; black magic has a dark side. Vaadin UI development knowledge is a plus. Don’t know Vaadin? Some GWT experience gets you halfway there. DVCS experience. Mercurial knowledge is perfect; Git competence and an open mind are good enough. Knowing enough JavaScript to code your way out of a paper bag is helpful; knowing enough CSS to make the bag pretty and responsive is even better.  Background Experience:  Ability to take responsibility for the implementation, quality, and operation of large features, such as an epic-level story or multi-sprint feature. Ability to estimate size accurately and deliver on-time and to specification regularly based on those estimates. Experience translating large features into software designs. 5 years’ software development experience, full life cycle development. 3 years’ experience developing apps on the specific platform. 5+ years’ of practical work experience with Java or JavaScript on a cloud-based platform. Experience using Docker on a cloud-based platform is a plus, particularly having scaled containers across multiple Docker daemons. Experience using continuous deployment / continuous integration (CI / CD) technology. Able to produce coherent and audience friendly written documentation. Professional communication skills both written and verbal.  Additional Job Information: The location is Chicago, IL at the HDMS office- 550 W Washington Blvd.  Clinical Licensure: N/A  Potential Telework Position: Yes  Percent of Travel Required: 0 - 10%  EEO Statement: Aetna is an Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action Employer  Benefit Eligibility: Benefit eligibility may vary by position.
