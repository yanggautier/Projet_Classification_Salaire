Data Scientist;Snapdocs;USA;Denver, CO;None;None;Hello Denver! We are excited to be here! Snapdocs is an early-stage startup backed by investors like Sequoia, F-Prime Capital, SV Angel, and YCombinator looking for an empathetic and curious Data Scientist to join our small Data team. Are you interested in bringing an industry into the future with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and automation? Then this role is for you. We're a small team tackling the absolutely massive mortgage market. We're bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manila envelopes. We bring security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.  The type of problems we focus on involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservices is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.  We trust our team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as collaboration. We're becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and now we're looking to hire another Data Scientist to help us expand further!  As the second Data Scientist to join the team, you will focus on aggregating and analyzing large datasets to identify behavior trends using statistics, data mining techniques, and building data models for solving real-world problems. The ideal candidate is someone who relishes pouring over messy data to find patterns and train machines to do so with high accuracy and recall. You will build and update models ( ML and AI ) to automate repetitive repeatable data-driven tasks. You will analyze data generated as a by-product of manual tasks and build models that can operate on similar or better accuracy than humans.  Over the past 2-4 years, you have learned and used advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms to build new models to experiment with data. You have experience in one or more programming languages including Python and R and have used Cloud Platforms, bonus points for AWS. This is a specialized role so advanced degrees in quantitative disciplines like Statistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics are preferred (PhD’s are ideal). Lastly, you are eager to learn! You don’t know every toolset but have proven that with the right problem, a good tutorial, and a healthy appetite for StackOverflow, you’ll figure it out but you don’t mind asking simple questions that result in actionable insights if need be.  Snapdocs’ culture is one that strongly values diversity and drive. We want to work with people of different backgrounds and different paths in life, and we trust our team members to make smart decisions. We value independent work as well as collaboration. Snapdocs provides a ton of excellent benefits ranging from the standard stuff: matching 401(k), free lunches, and 21 days PTO to the not so standard—like a 10 year exercise window on your options. Lastly, our location in downtown Denver is super convenient (we are currently based in the Wells Fargo Center) and close to many public transportation options.

This is a role for someone with experience manipulating large and diverse datasets with the know-how to coax data diamonds out of the rough. This is the first offering of this type within our organization and will report to the CTO.  Airspace Link is headquartered out of Detroit, MI with a remote office in northern Utah. We’d love for candidates to be centered in these geographic regions but understand that the best person for the job may live somewhere else. In short, the right remote candidates are considered, however Detroit based candidates will be given preference. International candidates are not considered at this time.  We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are eager to further diversify our company. Airspace Link is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.  About The Job  The Geospatial Data Scientist will be part of an agile team responsible for deriving risk associated with the potential of drone operational failures. The more these vehicles go up, the more likely they'll come down, and our mission is to build the best probability models in the industry. Risk can be quantified by a wide range of external influencers, including both predictable and unpredictable (e.g. weather) aerial and ground-based factors.  If you're digging the autonomous future, this role is for you. You will be directly influencing the ability for autonomous drone operations to be a successful national integration, instead of a tragic news headline.  You'll be working with a diverse set of authoritative geospatial data provided through our clients, in conjunction with public and other 3rd-party datasets to help build our data product and solution offerings.  Your output will be shared via application programming interfaces (API), web and mobile applications, single-use digital maps and reports, or even simple internal spreadsheets.

You'll be expected to come to the table with commercial and academic experience in data science, data mining, statistics (including probability theory), graph algorithms, machine learning, and spatial optimization. That's to say, there will be alot of hard problems to solve and you'll need a strong and diverse toolbox to get the work done. As an expert, you'll be expected to recommend and execute on overall modeling strategies with confidence and a well conceived notion on how to succeed.  You are thoughtful in the evaluation of your models, improving them over time as they interact with real users.  Some of the bullet points: Proficiency with Esri software suite, including raster analytics Strong analytic, cartographic, and presentation skills Ability to develop robust data queries using SQL Graduate level competency in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or equivalent scientific field Some experience with cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc) Excellent coding skills, especially in Python or R  About Our Pay & Benefits  Airspace Link, by all definitions, is a startup. Some of you may look on our status like you would at grabbing the last Walmart shopping cart with the askew front wheel. Others will view this as a unique opportunity in a greenfield industry with huge potential upside. We hope you’re the latter.  We aim to be competitive but won’t be making any headlines [yet]. We offer a full health benefit package that is tiered depending on your tenure with Airspace Link. In other words, our benefits move from good, to better, to best.  We support a life well lived away from work. None of our benefits are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours, ample vacation time, fitness, wellness, and healthy living.  How To Apply  Please send an application tailored to this position that speaks to us. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us the future.  We value good communication and solid writing is part of that. We expect to see a well-constructed cover letter along with your professional history. Forget the generic resume (and it's so blatantly obvious). There's no prize for being first. Copy and paste doesn't make it very far and we strongly encourage you to take this part of the application process seriously.  In case this job gets crawled and posted somewhere unexpected, you may or may not have an ""apply now"" link, but ultimately you should end up applying here: https://airspacelink.com/geospatial-data-scientist/  We look forward to hearing from you!"

The mission of the Marketplace Integrity team is to enable people to safely and confidently interact on Marketplace, and the analytics team is a critical function to achieve this goal. Trust is an exciting, critical, and challenging new area of Marketplace Integrity. Integrity is not just about fighting the bad, it’s also about promoting the good.

This requires a delicate trade-off between short-term transactions gain and long-term transactions that come from loyalty/experience.

This is the first offering of this type within our organization and will report to the CTO.  Airspace Link is headquartered out of Detroit, MI with a remote office in northern Utah. We’d love for candidates to be centered in these geographic regions but understand that the best person for the job may live somewhere else. In short, the right remote candidates are considered, however Detroit based candidates will be given preference. International candidates are not considered at this time.  We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are eager to further diversify our company. Airspace Link is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.  About The Job  The Geospatial Data Scientist will be part of an agile team responsible for deriving risk associated with the potential of drone operational failures. The more these vehicles go up, the more likely they'll come down, and our mission is to build the best probability models in the industry. Risk can be quantified by a wide range of external influencers, including both predictable and unpredictable (e.g. weather) aerial and ground-based factors.  If you're digging the autonomous future, this role is for you. You will be directly influencing the ability for autonomous drone operations to be a successful national integration, instead of a tragic news headline.  You'll be working with a diverse set of authoritative geospatial data provided through our clients, in conjunction with public and other 3rd-party datasets to help build our data product and solution offerings.  Your output will be shared via application programming interfaces (API), web and mobile applications, single-use digital maps and reports, or even simple internal spreadsheets.

You'll be expected to come to the table with commercial and academic experience in data science, data mining, statistics (including probability theory), graph algorithms, machine learning, and spatial optimization. That's to say, there will be alot of hard problems to solve and you'll need a strong and diverse toolbox to get the work done. As an expert, you'll be expected to recommend and execute on overall modeling strategies with confidence and a well conceived notion on how to succeed.  You are thoughtful in the evaluation of your models, improving them over time as they interact with real users.  Some of the bullet points: Proficiency with Esri software suite, including raster analytics Strong analytic, cartographic, and presentation skills Ability to develop robust data queries using SQL Graduate level competency in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or equivalent scientific field Some experience with cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc) Excellent coding skills, especially in Python or R  About Our Pay & Benefits  Airspace Link, by all definitions, is a startup. Some of you may look on our status like you would at grabbing the last Walmart shopping cart with the askew front wheel. Others will view this as a unique opportunity in a greenfield industry with huge potential upside. We hope you’re the latter.  We aim to be competitive but won’t be making any headlines [yet]. We offer a full health benefit package that is tiered depending on your tenure with Airspace Link. In other words, our benefits move from good, to better, to best.  We support a life well lived away from work. None of our benefits are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite.

Each year, the Brown Institute awards close to $1M in grants and fellowships to foster new tools and modes of expression, and to create stories that escape the bounds of page and screen. We are committed to radical experimentation with the potential to define new priorities and practices for both engineering and journalism. The Brown Institute at CJS is seeking a Research Scholar (open rank) to serve as a data specialist in support the Institute’s research and grants. This person will play both a high-level role reporting directly to the Director of the Institute at Columbia, helping provide data expertise and assistance to the Institute’s various grant and fellowship programs, as well as assisting in the implementation of seminars and workshops that engage the CJS and Columbia University (CU) communities in data-related topics. The primary function of the Institute is to serve as a grant making organization. As such, the Institute has funded over 50 projects, supporting well over 150 grantees and fellows. Due to our position as a joint venture between Stanford Engineering and Columbia Journalism School, as well as seismic shifts in the journalism industry that have led many organizations to focus heavily on data and computation, many of our projects are rooted in data-based storytelling. In our 2019-2020 Magic Grant cycle alone, the Brown Institute at Columbia is explicitly supporting three projects that are essentially database research endeavours. One project, for example, is focused on acquiring and aggregating human rights violations in Pakistan to enable better reporting on the country. Another project is focused on producing a comprehensive database of maternal deaths in Nigeria, as well as providing systematic assessment of the efficacy of health interventions in the country. And yet another project is developing an automated database of the Trump administration’s 3000+ current and former appointees, enabling journalists to report on stories about appointees’ interests and potential conflicts, and how those impact policymaking. The Research Scholar will be the lead data scientist for these projects — creating databases from possibly unstructured information; designing systems for the ingest, automation, and cleaning of future data; and helping journalists pull stories from the data. In addition to grants and fellowships, the Institute offers a number of pedagogical programs, from simple open office hours on topics like Data Visualization and Mapping, to seminars and conferences about the role of data in journalism. The Research Scholar will have the opportunity to assist in these efforts, helping design and lead workshops, provide office hours to the school, and work on personal projects that align with the mission of the Institute. This is an exciting new role that will leverage the incredible grants we have funded, as well as our connections to industry and to the academic environment in which we exist. These tasks mean that the Research Scholar should have a firm grounding in all things data. Applicants should be fluent in at least one programming language, preferably Python or R, and should have a history of learning new technological platforms as well as a general curiosity about how technology might shape narrative. The Research Scholar will also be encouraged to seek out and develop their own novel data projects, and might also teach a course in the CJS, with the goal of promoting the mix of data and journalism in new ways. This position will be appointed for up to 12 months, may be renewable contingent on performance and the continued availability of funding.   Minimum Degree Required Bachelor’s Degree required   Minimum Qualifications Experience with data and computation, and fluency in a programming language   Preferred Qualifications Advanced degree preferred   Additional Information Other Skills: Has ability to work easily with teams of journalists and other members of the Brown Institute and the CJS community. Should be familiar with current technological innovations in one or more of the following areas: visualization, physical computing, app development, game design, general data and computer science, and computational media. An appreciation for the power of a good story and the ability to experiment with the technical means of its production are key.
